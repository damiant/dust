# Roadmap

# Bugs

- iOS: The filter on the home page for "regionals" etc cannot be dismissed by clicking elsewhere (works on Android)
- Images are in `webp` but you when you use the share plugin these image types dont appear (at least on iOS). Maybe convert to png?
- Only show the "Now" button if it is within the events date range

- PWA to Microsoft store: https://tech.lgbt/@lilPWA/111711138018508269
- Art tour audio
- Group multiple parties on music into the one card

# Ideas

## Check In

- Check In Button - For events, add to check in history on the more tab
- Only show check in if distance = near and event is between start and end
- Checked in events show with a tick next to them

## Share My Location

- Share my location - Capture map image and share with GPS coords.

- Art page - map option to show all close art
- Favorites by distance
- Distance - use km and meters if region (or setting)

## Feedback
