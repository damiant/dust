# Difficult to solve

- Overlapping events are hard to see - Maybe some indicator of this

# Bugs

- iOS: The filter on the home page for "regionals" etc cannot be dismissed by clicking elsewhere (works on Android)
- Images are in `webp` but you when you use the share plugin these image types dont appear (at least on iOS). Maybe convert to png?

## Feedback

- Reminder times configurable (Google App Reviewer)
- Camps filter by clock (eg Near 7:00 which would be 6:30-7:30) (Robin)
- Google nearby plugin - use for bluetooth chat feature

## Burner Map

- Give option to share on social media with a link to add friend into dust

## Check In

- Only show check in if distance = near and event is between start and end
- Checked in events show with a tick next to them
