# Difficult to solve

- Overlapping events are hard to see - Maybe some indicator of this

# Bugs

- iOS: The filter on the home page for "regionals" etc cannot be dismissed by clicking elsewhere (works on Android)
- Images are in `webp` but you when you use the share plugin these image types dont appear (at least on iOS). Maybe convert to png?
