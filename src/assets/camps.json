If you couldn't tell, we like Austin Powers. A lot. We aim to confuse and entertain with many hours of house & techno, an interactive bar, and shade to provide dusty explorers with some reprieve. We are a camp of about 30 members who are passionate about art and music.\n\nIf you're biking by our camp during one of our parties, you'll likely be pulled in by one of our enthusiastic camp members. You will find it hard to leave. Otherwise we let the sound and music speak, and those meant to stop by, ultimately will.",

Learning to listen, to be patient, to understand, to forgive and to be more merciful: these are among the skills we practice in becoming more human. \n\nIn 2022, we will be inviting others to join us in this practice through a series of interactive experiences that explore ourselves, our connection to each other, and how the 10 Principles help guide that discovery.

To accomplish this mission we gift lights to dark burners and their bikes and engage in community outreach efforts to promote the importance of remaining visible at night.  \n\nDarkwad Patrols hosts lighting workshops about the many ways to accessorize your bike and body with lights.  We also provide a 24-hour Light-Share Drop Box where burners can gift lights to fellow burners and dark burners can take the lights they need.",

Crossroads' unique energy and next-level musical talent draws humongous crowds who come with a serious hunger to sing and dance and drink, while Moon Cheese serves up the tastiest grilled cheeses with all different types of bread and cheese, including gluten-free bread and vegan cheese, as well as a range of sweet, spicy, tangy and juicy dipping sauces. This year we're so jazzed to be adding a brand new food offering: French toast! And at the bar... popsicles!",

Only in recent years have we separated ourselves with walls and highways, buildings that block the sun, shoes that keep our feet from touching the soil. Take us back to our roots! The magic is still there, deep in the jungle and beneath the surface of the playa. We conjure it through ritual, art, music, dance, deep connection and wild celebration.\nSacbe Camp brings this philosophy to Burning Man, which is a ritual of its own. Created in good spirit, and in honor of all things \"chido\", Sacbe is a celebration of human potential and a collective conjuring of everything that is magic in the world.",

We teach people to heal themselves through their original connection with spirit, their truest nature. \"Shamanista\" is our belief that the shamanic healer is in everyone.\n\nIf you're a shamanic practitioner, Shamandome will welcome you as a guest healer.

    "description": "Nothing in life is permanent. Once it happened, it passed. The only constant is the ever-evolving present. But what happens when we add synthetic intelligent life into the equation? What is its perception of 'life'? Can it go back or forward in time? Is it fully awaken or deeply asleep..?\u00a0 Our thematic camp CYBER DREAMS explores the idea of AI dreaming of its human experience. It came from the outer space and\u00a0crashed in Black Rock City and now a group of sci-fi researchers set up a camp around it to investigate the unknown object. The study shows that the new  'entity' is actually in the state of a deep sleep, dreaming. It is in its final moments before it fades, rendering out a new world for the new AI. It also renders us humans. It dreams of itself. So we wonder\u2026 are WE truly awake?",

Steam-16 is what we can come in contact with, what we can catalyze within ourselves and propagate into expanding communal circles. It's precious, elusive, and only available once the danger is imminent - an antithesis to the Ice-9, of a sorts. As much as Ice-9 freezes - Steam-16 elevates, cleans and connects.",
