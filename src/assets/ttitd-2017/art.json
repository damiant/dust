The acrylic panels contain designs evocative of our shared experience on the playa.  These designs may include elements of such radical rituals as seeing the sun rise behind a temple, being caught in a dust storm, and dancing to incredible music only heard once anywhere in the world.\r\n\r\nDuring the darker hours, a system of flex sensors, micro-controllers, and LEDs will bring the wind to life.  With calm wind, the structure will gently pulse in different colors and shifting patterns.  When the wind picks up, the lights will appear to \"flow\" with the direction of the wind, and the patterns and colors will move more quickly and intensely with more vivid colors.",

Allowing the spectator to become aware of this leads to the realization of previous ignorance.\r\n\r\nIn my research trip to Amsterdam I was able to talk to prostitutes that operate in the RLD. Hearing their opinions on how \"the windows\" concept results in psychological effects on the client. Although \"the windows\" began as an element of accessibility, it has now evolved to an iconic attraction element of prostitution in the Red Light District.",

The art piece we want to create will be a space to provide transformative rituals, and a place where we will hold workshops in how you can hold space for others.",

    "description": "Why a monkey? Why a bust? Why BE ART? All great questions about one of artist Laura Kimpton's latest sculptures. \r\n\r\nEmbracing the tradition of centuries of high art that honored intellectuals, artists, men of power, BE ART creates a playful, thought-provoking message about art. Standing approximately 16 feet tall, the sculpture is a bust of a monkey with breasts and wearing epaulets. \r\n\r\nAround her neck is a gold-plated necklace that proudly exclaims BE ART.  Both the sculpture and the necklace remind us to not only see the art, but recognize that we ARE the living embodiment of art.",

Despite their humor and charm, these brightly colored, misshapen Babies collectively hold up a mirror to those who stumble upon and wander through their celebration. Some chatter, some canoodle, some whoop, some are overwhelmed and some feel as though they don't belong at the party at all. While the Babies' collective placement in deep playa reflects the isolation of being on the fringes of society, Odd Jelly Out is testament both to the artist's warm nostalgia for her native Britain, and the childhood ritual of daily, post-school visits to the sweetshop.",

It improves infinitely with wear, becoming something burnished, something better.  Sometimes water is the agent of change, wearing down the edges and smoothing over the brittleness of its natural state. Other times stone is worn by centuries of human footsteps, traveling the long roads to market, to worship, to home.  The tops of these tables are ancient granite stair blocks; their worn surfaces bear witness to 600-900 years of architectural service.   Collected and re-purposed, these blocks are crafted into useful objects meant to sit at the heart of human exchange. \r\n\r\nRhodes adds, \"Like much of my work, Lithic Altars sit at the crossroads of architecture and sculpture. They inhabit a gray between monumental and intimate not frequently explored.\"",

On the two opposite sides leading into the entrances, there's a candle-lit red carpet, with guiding ropes, hanging bells & chimes. Pews, facing the confessional, invite onlookers to see into the grid panels on the confessional, to view the silhouettes of those inside. Inside, participants sit facing a writing scroll, to write their confession on, sharing their beauty of truth. It will be humbling to enter the booth, and as one sits down to write, or speaks to the silhouette of the confessor across from them, they will not only see a blank slate, but also see how many others sat in the same place before them, filling the wound up scroll with their innermost secrets, seeking absolution and freedom.",

    "description": "The Story Behind\r\nIn December 2016, a tragic attack hit near one of the memorial places in Berlin at Ged\u00e4chtniskirche (Church of Memory in the center of the city). A man drove a heavy lorry into the crowded Christmas market. Twelve women and men came to death, others were heavily injured. This incident (which happened near to most of us living in Berlin) inspired us to develop the Shrine of Lost Moments as an art project at Burning Man 2017.\r\n\r\nThe Project\r\nWe all have periods, relationships, or people in our lives that either end or disappear too early, that we have no time to say farewell to or process, or things that we want to end and can\u2019t. Giving these transitions an active place of remembrance and farewell, as a place of transition;\r\nwe want to create the shrine of lost moments at Burning Man 2017. The lost moment might also be a period or person that you want to embrace and bring back into memory.\r\n\r\nThe visitor of the shrine is encouraged to interact and engage: he or she takes a colored piece of cardboard \u2013 the Remembrance Piece. This piece is cut in the form of the tower of the Berlin\u2019s Ged\u00e4chtniskirche (memorial church) and contains the shadow of a person (inspired\r\nby the shadow of vaporized victims of the Hiroshima-bombing).\r\n\r\nPeople can take one of the remembrance pieces and write a name, life period, situation\u2026 they want to remember, embrace or eliminate from their lives. Both positive and burdening memories are welcome. Then, the remembrance piece can be broken in two parts \u2013 a little bit\r\nlike the identity tag (dog tag) that soldiers carry around their necks when on a mission. The upper part stays with the burner; the lower part will be placed at the shrine \u2013 designed as a colorful \u201ctree of life.\u201d The tree of life will be burned with the attached Remembrance Pieces together with the Man.",

You can imagine the rest... Yes! it\u00b4s a miracle!

Many openings are for notes and prayers, and interior for small relics from the public.\r\nIn Native American culture, the four arrows at the cardinal points in a circle are all pointing inwards. The circle represents the world and also an individual. The arrows represent \"the attitudes or attributes with which a person must view every event and consider every problem if he is to find enlightenment\". Thus he must look at things from:\r\n1) The direction of wisdom (arrow of the North)\r\n2) The direction of innocence (the arrow of the south) 3) The direction of Introspection (the arrow of the West) 4) The direction of far sight (the arrow of the East)\"",

The word that is displayed is \"WORD\" and the surface of the structure is covered in pages of scripture from the world's major religions.  The choice of word is a biblical reference to John 1:1: \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\"  The structure stands as a dual monument: first, as a tribute to the power of word as a force of creation and second, as a statement about the relationship between words and spiritual identity.",

    "description": "Science is the new religion in our lives and this work will provide an immediacy of science play which releases a vision of the universe as a complex machine.  Scientists must envision and study unimaginable forces, distances, and time spans.  Thus a leap of faith through rationality extends experience beyond the realm of our normal senses.  We will show citizens that interstellar radiation has been continually bombarding their own body though beyond their awareness.  The goal of this effort is to engage the Playa explorer with the playful interaction of \"catching\" a cosmic ray; seeing its path through their body. Our desire is to move beyond experiential-based rationality into a more fundamental contemplation of vast scales of time and space and thereby surrender to a realization of our own insignificance.   And if we are insignificant what is the role of our uniqueness and our belief in sacred things? ?  Isn't it absurd to be simultaneously unique and yet totally insignificant?",

Maya's Mind is a 15 foot tall 8 feet wide sculpture of Maya Angelou the African American great poet. This sculpture will be a large bust that will be placed on 3 books lying flat and creating a stairway that you can walk up into Maya's mind.\r\n\r\nThe top of her head on the inside will be hanging a Birdcage that has no bottom and inside will be a bird in honor of her most famous book I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings. On top of her bust she'll have a head wrap that turns into Birds taking flight symbolizing I Rise I Rise Again. Walking up into the back of the open head area will be a mural of her childhood and different phases of her life including her famous poetry readings and interaction touching surfaces with different textures and shapes and discovering hidden pictures under, in, and around things. I am hoping to have voice activation for some of her poetry if I get permission to use her voice. Her voice is unique and powerful.",

A Gamelatron is a sound producing kinetic sculpture presented as site-specific installations, and stand alone art works by Aaron Taylor Kuffner. Gamelatrons are made from traditional bronze, brass and iron instruments from Indonesia's gamelan tradition, retrofitted with mechanical mallets on sculptural mounting systems. The pieces are connected to a network that transcribes digital compositions into an array of electrical pulsations that results in a ghostly musical automaton.",

There are four benches around the art allowing Black Rock City citizens to sit, gather, discuss the art, or just relax on their journey across the Playa.  \r\n\r\nI would hope the piece sparks discussion on being your true self, to open up to all aspects of life and what it has to offer.  In short, to come out of the corner you may be in and stand in the light of life.  Feel your Bliss.",

The art of animating human or animal form has fascinated mankind since before the birth of Christ.\r\n\r\nThere is a personal catalyst in bringing our animal automata to the Playa.  One of our artist's brothers died young when he was overcome with cancer related to AIDS. He was a fantastic person and brought so much joy the lives of so many others. One of his most prized possessions included a collection of wooden automata animals.  \r\n\r\nIt is in his memory, and with great joy that we bring these pieces to life in Black Rock City.  The automata will be large interactive sculptures that poke fun at and bring life to the radical rituals of animal playfulness and pleasure.  Five or six free range animals will round out the menagerie.",

    "description": "Project #8 on the Deep Playa Trash Phence,  S I N Z, is talking to you!   60 signs will dance on the  green phence posts, each one unique  and quirky. As you ride or walk along the phence you will discover a special part of BRC. Chuckle and relate (not a law firm) your way as you negotiate the beauty of the deep playa. Each  sign has a hidden or blatant playa meaning. Feel free to reorient them if the winds have turned them, some have messages on the back intended for the perimeter crew and law enforcement  agencies that patrol outside the phence. A few wind chimes will gently orient you. The Electric Horseman will churn the dust as he does his thing year after year. JustGeorge, CowboyKarl and the Phence crew are the real phence artists out there.  So get out to the deep playa, 'cuz art is in your camps, its on your wheels, its - well its also where you least expect it.

It is not only an echo of this year's Burning Man \"Radical Ritual\" theme, but also a reflection of our desire, enthusiasm and understanding of the circle of life. It is about soar, failure, revival and reincarnation, and countless uncertainties and possibilities in existence. \r\n\r\nTwelve feet long and spreading 36 ft wide, the wood triune wings will shed beautiful shadows on Playa in the morning, will post as a blurry spikes in the dust, and will be an eye candy after sunset with visible LED lit figure to warm home goers' hearts at night. \r\n\r\nBlueLotusCamp has been an active contributor to our community with art and imagination. We truly believe that this \"Fallen Wings\" will, as always, be our gift to our fellow burners and to the BRC home.",

A 20 foot length of steel pipe acts as the sounding box, while a theramin antenna at the end controls a series of electromagnets that actuate a strand of piano wire within.  It is designed to be minimal and unassuming, while still having an intriguing presence. Participants will be drawn in by its form, and only upon closer inspection will they discover something completely unexpected and wonderful. As they get close to or reach out to touch the end of the pipe, they will notice a soft musical sound starting to emit. If they move their hand closer to the antenna, the pitch of the sound will rise, and as they move their hand away the pitch will fall. The experience will be the interface of a traditional theramin, but with a more real, physical sound.",

    "description": "The Gift of Good Fortune is a forced perspective image stretched across multiple rectangular frames.  From any angle other than the apex viewpoint, the piece appears as separate geometric parts, reducing in size from one end to the other.  From a single viewing position, all pieces of the image align to create a flat, unified portrait of the Hindu deity Ganesha.\r\n\r\nIn Hindu tradition, Ganesha is the deity tasked with removing obstacles and creating good fortune.  As powerful as faith can be, however, most obstacles will not be overcome by faith alone.  It requires some level of human intervention.  This often requires a willingness to look at the problem from multiple different perspectives.  Once you have examined the impediment from varying points of view, the path forward becomes much clearer.",

The family of Black Bart ( The famous Wells Fargo stage coach robber) gave the gun handle to add to Claude. He also has the ashes of the late Great Buck Dan Jones welded into a oil fitting. There is a oven door on his right side to access  the inside where we become the Wizard of Oz. There is a steering wheel and nematic levels so his head turns and goes up and down. His mouth opens and he breathes fire. The operator can  look out of the scales to communicate with participants. We are looking forward to seeing everyone at home.",

    "description": "The Black Rock Observatory opens the door for people to a new or renewed love of science. From the simplest observations of the skies man's curiosity was piqued, and modern science and all its discoveries were born. It intends to inspire that same emotion in those who visit. From dust, we give people the stars. Here at the Observatory we seek to expand both mind and soul. Here we show off the stars, tell stories from ages past that give the constellations their names. Here we teach of meteorites and pass them from hand to hand. Here we discuss science in all its forms and weave a tapestry of how and where and why that enlightens and inspires. And what is that, if not the very core of art?\r\n \r\nOur main telescope is a Dobsonian with a 20\" mirror, larger than many permanent public observatories. The smaller scopes are only smaller by comparison; they, too are possessed of relatively large mirrors. Nothing can prepare the soul for the endless beauty of the universe.",

There is a replica of a curled-up cat, sleeping on top of the washing machine.\r\n\r\nThe altar is framed by a square portal, made out of galvanized pipes. A battery-powered strobe is attached to the frame right above the altar, flashing once every minute, illuminating the altar and whoever else happens to be interacting with it.\r\n\r\nThe skull is surrounded by thick, convoluted layers of impenetrable metal, symbolizing our reality tunnels, often as thick, convoluted and impenetrable. The altar is a contemplation on the artist's reality tunnel; albeit not a gloomy one - after all, the skull is looking out onto the open playa and Black Rock City citizens, who happen to be interacting with the altar.",

It is the fusion of music and light in an enclosed space.  Its inherent interactivity allows the citizens of Black Rock City to become the composer of their own visual experience.  It's a place to be amazed at the art, but also as an amazing part of one's journey through the playa.  The enclosed environment completely engulfs you in a world of interactive light patterns & full-surround sound.  Play with it and watch how your fellow citizens express themselves, or even create a shared experience!",

Varying in height a few feet over head, the rings rhythmically pulse, dim, and color shift. Dusty denizens stroll through the field of light.\r\n\r\nAmbient ethereal sound filters through the air, layered NASA space recordings: interstellar plasma whirls, lightning from Jupiter, deep-bass starlight waves, Saturn's melodic hum.    \r\n\r\nThree microphones stand ready, adding human voice to the mix. As people sing, speak or whisper into the mics, the hovering illuminated rings respond, matching color and intensity to vocal rhythms. \r\n\r\nAs midnight nears, people patiently watch the horizon, as each of the Big Dipper's seven stars slowly glides into center-point alignment inside the illuminated rings. Midnight ritual ensues: a learned astronomer opens minds and hearts to cosmic wonder in a guided meditative tour of the night sky.",

In ritual that stretches back before humans \u2013 and that also anticipates a future when they don't exist \u2013 the sidhe revel in the endless cycle of light and dark. The court bursts from the Otherworld, and bystanders see a dark figure with pulsing veins of red light and a silver face that reflects a person's soul, followed by cavorting figures who tap on many drums. \r\n\r\nIn caricature of the Pied Piper leading children astray, some of the sidhe beat a march, while other figures dart among onlookers, drawing bystanders in as the group strides toward ritual stations of drum and light. The court \u2013 and its new attendants \u2013 pound a rhythm as the sun sinks below the horizon towards the inevitable transformation of light to dark. The sidhe and its new court howl in joy as the sun drops past the skyline, and the blessed cool of night bathes the land in its embrace.",

Sometimes crossing a bridge happens as a rite of passage.  Sometimes one is stuck forever at a door that never opens, grieving for a dream that is never granted. However there is always the eternal return to the bridge, an endless yearning to travel across into a better, brighter place.  We are like plants in the soil that always strive to reach for the sun.\r\n\r\nTHE CAGE stages the fact that we're trapped by profound ignorance and limited cognitive capacity. We're trapped by our need for absolute  good and evil. Our human choices lead us into vulnerability and into natural disaster. We are surprised at our suffering, when this is history of the world.",

Here a fairytale castle provides magical vistas to those that climb atop and shelter to those within. Pipelines provide speedy transportation between locations and may contain hidden treasure. \r\n\r\nIt's the racers and crowd, however, whose participation truly creates the experience. Similar to a child's big wheel, racers ride trikes low to the ground as the trike's lights react to the raceway. With a blur of speed and a trail of dust, the themed trikes and costumed racers circle past fevered spectators demonstrating the power of the electric drives. Racers need to keep an eye out for items placed by spectators and other racers which are either power-ups or obstacles affecting the speed of the trikes.",

This piece approaches the cosmological understanding of creation and being as viewed through the lens of Plato's Timaeus, wherein the Demiurge (or Craftsperson) is understood for transforming ideas (Ideals) into reality. Just as the Demiurge created the universe, so will Participants in this installation be able to help create a facet of the Burning Man reality and world by interacting with a display that shifts in various modes of communication (symbols, colors, movement) relative to movement. Both the installation and the Participants will evolve and change as a result of each other, creating a microcosm of a universal approach towards growth and creativity. \r\n\r\nThe installation is comprised of three major parts: a canvas of changing colors that represents the collective unconscious, the dynamically-changing display inspired by the Mind, and the sensors wherein participants interact in reality.",

I will invite people to talk about what stops us from being the beautiful human beings we all are and to talk about what problems seem to hold us back or what situations can stop us from succeeding on our own lives. \r\n\r\nI know small moments can make a difference in someone's life. Some of these moments happened to me at Burning Man the last few years. \r\n\r\nMy vision for this art piece and the world is to help and empower people, by creating love and freedom, so we can be and express ourselves from the beautiful inner child we all are.",

The sign itself is made out of reclaimed sheet metal and discarded letters from dismantled corporate signs, hand painted, lit by 300 ten-watt incandescent bulbs and securely attached to a welded base with wheels (and sometimes, pedal-power) so the piece is fully mobile across the playa. You can usually find the BORING sign accompanying burns, alongside popular art projects, and framing the silhouette of the Man at sunset. With four 500-watt speakers and a playlist of danceables from the 60s, 70s and 80s, the mobile, rolling sign often attracts an entourage of sunset or late night boogie revelers.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/campboring",

I will bring some kind of film project to playa every year. In this simple design of 5 vintage televisions and 5 vintage wooden chairs sitting in front of them for individual consumption. Each television will play an original film with the through line of or theme of Radical Ritual. The films' footage will be accumulated by a number of artists to create 5 short films touching on ritual and how it frees us, or how it imprisons us, how it brings us comfort, how it gives us anxiety.",

Industrial elements blend with an organic tree-like form to create an amalgamation of the man-made and natural worlds.  With their canopy of motion, light, and shadow, large horizontal paddle wheels create a contemplative Zen-like space.  As our ecosystems are increasingly under assault, may this environmentally interactive sculpture be a reminder of our need to work with, rather than against, nature.",

    "description": "Magnetic Waltz is an interactive kinetic display based on ferrofluid (a magnetic liquid) which invites Participants to explore the bewildering interplay of magnetics, fluid mechanics, and gravity. The ferrofluid dances and twirls, choreographed via hidden electronically-controlled magnets. As participants dance in front of the piece, it responds to their movements. Ferrofluid is a magical substance which inspires participants to take a closer look and question their perceptions. What is it made of? Why does it ooze and form those intricate labrynthian patterns? How can it seem to defy gravity? Is it alive? Will it be my friend?\r\n\r\nThe Phage's mission is to bring the joy of science to the Playa. As a scientist, peering into a microscope and observing a phenomenon for the first time inspires child-like wonder and curiosity. We hope that Magnetic Waltz evokes similar feelings.",

It is a mysterious little grove which has a life on its own, but every participant who steps inside contributes directly to the feedback of the installation - just like a forest organically interacts with its inhabitants. \r\nAlthough a mirage of electronic nature, the grove aims to illustrate the imprint and connections everyone has to each other and their surroundings.",

The Journey's toroidal structure is a mortise and tenon, interlocking wood construction forming 36 interconnected rings. Each ring is a double helix, 10' in diameter, creating an 8' interior corridor that circumnavigates a 22' circular inner courtyard. The installation's footprint is 42' in diameter.\r\n\r\nPre-programmed sounds, such as sunrise/sunset meditations, help participants reflect on their own journey. The interior surfaces of the double helix passageway have addressable LED lights. By day, the structure is a walkable audio enhanced interactive piece allowing individuals to examine the beauty of the construction. By night the piece's impact is based on the light experience and its responsiveness to the audio and environment.",

You mount the Tower and quickly get engrossed in the art and the prose.  You notice that there is a little bin of colored markers.  You grab one and carry it with you as you wander up and around the Tower, waiting for that inspirational message to spark a reaction.

    "description": "\"Interspecies Communication,\" is an interactive kinetic-musical-sculpture of metal birds and fish, and was inspired by the idea of spontaneous group behavior. From the unprompted assembly of molecules that led to life, to the behavior of social communities, the ability for an individual to react to change through the influence of those around it contributes to a spontaneous behavior of a larger group without a single leader. \r\n\r\nAs Participants climb onto the sculpture and cause it to move and to sound, their influence on each other, in combination with the sense of interspecies communication inherent in causing the bird to sing, creates a spontaneous ritual behavior that leads to group cohesion. Like a bird murmuration and a school of fish, the forms of the sculpture (made up of smaller bird and fish forms) hint at the remarkable ability of many individuals to maintain cohesion as a group in highly uncertain environments and with limited, noisy information.",

The Metaheart is a mirror-clad, 3D form that rises 23' from the ground and reflects anyone who sees it and the environment surrounding. With its 3 arching arms, the heart motif can be recognized from any direction or distance.  In the center (the heart of the heart), dwells a jungle gym in the ancient geometric shape of medatrons cube. This rotates under human power with the participation of any curious admirer who's willing to spin the structure. \r\n\r\nThe Metaheart is about infinite discovery. The geometric shape in the center of the heart represents expansion in every axis and plane. At the base of the heart lies a biometric sensor where anyone who approaches is welcome to place their hand. The computer driven LED's lining the entire heart will pulsate with the rhythm of the participant heart beat. Three red lasers, each at a 33 degree angle atop the sculpture, sweep the sky.\r\n.",

Their collections and stashes of pseudoscientific clutter contain clues to solving a sci-fi mystery representative of the anti-ritual, the unfounded, and unexplainable.

    "description": "When you approach this dilapidated factory, you'll see a wooden structure that looks long abandoned --- graffiti on the outside, and ghosts of industry at the entry way.  As you make your way around fallen trusses towards a mysterious altar in the middle of the structure, you'll see threatening clouds and an offering to the gods of industry, along with the handle to a mysterious crank that could have something to do with a kinetic automaton.  What happens when you turn the crank?  Why has industry sucked all color and sound out of this place?  \r\n\r\nOnce the clouds part and a giant finger has accepted or rejected the offering, faint music starts to play and lights start to shine out of the slats in a garage at the back of the structure.  Drawn to the light, you walk towards it and notice that things start to have color and substance.  Entering the garage, you will find a replica of the original oscillator used in the soundtrack to Fantasia, and learn about the founding of Silicon Valley.",

The initial vision for the structure came from a recurring dream that the lead artist has had since childhood.

The focus of the trailer is the primary, 5 station, 3d viewer for looking at stereo-cards. It is a rotating contraption inspired by the 1890s \"Kaiser Panorama\", only in reduced table-top form.  \r\n\r\nAlongside the viewer is a bench (doubling as a storage unit) where Participants waiting to use the viewer can hang out while looking at additional 3d-cards using hand-held viewers. The entire piece is a work of art and craftsmanship, dedicated to the exhibition of another art form, stereo-photography. For its inaugural outing, it will feature the work of stereophotographers, or \"stereoburners\", who have recorded Burning Man over the last 20 years.",

Stained-glass windows adorn the walls.  Music evocative of each faith plays softly over concealed speakers.

Participants are invited to pull a series of 6 ropes which cause the wheel to rotate progressively faster. When the rope pullers are coordinated enough to get the wheel spinning at the correct speed, a strobe is activated, revealing the skeletons' animation. The animation tells the story of Charon, the mythological gondolier and ferryman of Hades who carried the souls of the recently departed across the river Styx, the last right of passage on the way to the afterlife.

    "description": "The Cosmic Space Worm is a pedal-powered art installation that consists of five adult tricycles linked together with a segmented aluminum worm on top.  It will have an industrial and robotic look, yet will also be very organic with the way it moves.   It will be illuminated through holes cut into the aluminum skin, as well as a row of spikes along its back.  Its eyes will glow brightly and its jaw will be articulated.  \n\nThe idea behind this installation is to create a giant, strange looking creature that needs the power of the people in order to come to life.",

Styled in the manner of a chapel one can find on the side of the street in the Chihuahuan Desert with Dia de los Muertos design, House of doG is a space to remember, pray, and give thanks for our beloved animal friends. Here, much like the Temple, people can participate by posting or writing about their animal relationship, confer and share stories with other travelers to this sacred site, or sip on some tequila in remembrance. Mexican culture is heavily laden with honoring and celebrating the lives of the past that came before to create what the present. It is also heavily Catholic, and to add an absurd twist the saints that will watch over this space will have the bodies of humans, but the heads of animals, as if St. Francis of Assisi became so in tune with them he became one.",

It goes dark, pulses & glows again.\r\n\r\nA central, pew-like hexagon with devotional texts is an invitation to kneel. The open texts contain series of colored dots in rows, corresponding to colored buttons. Pressed in sequence, lights darken, then begin to rise up the columns.\r\n\r\nTurning pages, pressing buttons, each page a ritual of motion necessary to light the shrine. For each 'ritual' the lights respond differently. Participants each control 1/6 of the lights. Working together, the intricacy of pattern increases. Combining sequences unlocks more colors & patterns. \r\n\r\nWhile not intended to represent any one form of worship, it contains elements of many. Faith, religion & spirituality are all related, a veneration of the source of the light that allows us to see the Universe around us.",

Old resentments can consume large amounts of life force just in the act of holding them in a stuck clenching pattern. This participatory installation will offer a safe and sacred space for pilgrims to be invited to shed obsolete patterns of all kinds. where in our world are we invited to behave this way? Usually these emotions are held invisibly on purpose, or else surface in unconscious ways. \r\n\r\nThis altar provides a permissive environment to expose oneself, privately or publicly, and even be encouraged to go deeper into exploring and letting go of resentments or attachments, things we once needed as coping mechanisms, but are now obsolete, yet we may never have purged them from our brain's hard drive. Time to clear space for new healing, new life force and space for new inspirations and ways of being in the world.",

Stylized giants appear as a ghostly dance of familiar yet mysterious shapes. \r\n\r\nFrom a distance the forms entice participants to wonder, and drawing nearer, the shapes may appear as intriguing possibilities of what they represent, Branchinecta sp. The fairy shrimp are constructed of rip-stop nylon, and float affixed to bamboo poles. The individual sculptures are around 12' long and 4' in diameter. They represent the very real and very tiny creatures underfoot. They emerge here to dance in unison with the wind.  When there is no wind, there is rest, and maybe some slight shade. Here is existence of a temporary nature - as fairy shrimp: to eat, to dance, to mate, and to enjoy each other's company before our pool dries up, again.",

Approaching PARAGATE one first encounters a 24' diameter ring of 64 solar lights defining a protected ritual space. At the center of this space resides the PARAGATE portal, a cylindrical steel gateway covered on all surfaces with a mosaic of 16,000 small, irregularly, cut mirrors. Moving closer, Black Rock City citizens find their mirror reflections multiplied and fractalized by the convex outer surface of the portal. \r\n\r\nEntering the convex inner portal, citizens find their reflection rearranged and compressed creating a cubist self-portrait. Inside the portal a hallucinatory audio collage designed to complement the citizens's mirror mosaic reflection runs nonstop during the event. An oracle offers the participant his or her appropriate ritualistic suggestion. On top of the portal 3 wind vanes turn in opposite directions creating a flurry of irrelevant motion signifying nothing.",

Sound elements conjure a sense of primordial place; the dry lakebed, the playa. Lighting for this installation is a simple circle of illumination, an ethereal cocoon; an open invitation for the continuation of the participatory experience into the night. \n\nIn some of the traditional stories, the thunderbirds number four, representing north, south, east, and west.

    "description": "A placid face of segmented, polished metal, eyes calm and lips pursed, supported by a neck armature containing two volumes, a diamond and a heart. Behind the mouth, inside the curve of the face is a diamond shaped combustion chamber and below it, just off the ground, a heart shaped bellows. A rod protrudes behind the head and joins to a levered handle, anchored to the ground so that a person acting on the handle will cause the bellows to expand and contract, forcing air through the combustion chamber and out of the mouth. Hot sparks from the burning wood will issue out on the exhale and the stoked combustion chamber will glow with heat, shining through the seams and incised writing on the face.",

We had intended it to be a helpful part of the Mask Making process inside the Guild Workshops.  While it worked very well in it's intended purpose, we were also overwhelmed by people who just wanted to DRAW.  At all hours of the day and night people were drawing like crazy on this 4 ft. by 8 ft. blank canvas.  We are trying to make a way for that same energy to be expressed in 12 to 14 different locations around Black Rock City this year.   We hope that by making beautiful hand crafted, large books (with artfully decorated pages) that people will have blank space to be creative with their time and this year's theme.",

The beauty of these installations is that it is for everyone: public art in its purist form; a series of affirmations- relevant to all of us, applicable on so many levels. It is the intent that everyone on their unique journeys will have an opportunity to be touched by a seemingly serendipitous message. All people \u2013 no matter how divergent their concerns, no matter how fragile or empowered they are \u2013 will be able to experience it and perhaps, receive the message they needed to see.\r\n \r\n\"Art is only real when shared.\"",

Throughout the Sierra Nevada, species of pine trees are dying, compromised by a bark beetle which has proliferated due to human interruption of the cycle of forest fires, and climate change. The material of these trees, donated to our project, harvested and milled, becomes the basic building block of the Temple. Interlocking timber pieces in formation become a Temple that is both cloud and spire; inverted pyramidal columns suggest the negative-space of a forest canopy, simultaneously supporting a vast pagoda-like 'cloud' framework which in turn supports a central spire. In this way disorder gives way to harmony, and a group of dying trees is re-ordered into a cathedral of timbers stretching toward the sky; filtered sun rays will illuminate the intricate work of hundreds of hands building in unison; a collaboration that knits together a community as roots intertwine to give a healthy forest stability.",

    "description": "Suspended 20 feet above the Playa, NOETICA looks solid and imposing.  The artwork evokes universal themes and flows from one portion of the sculpture to another.  Upon nearing, it becomes clear that the piece is in sinuous and seductive motion, and that the movements are interconnected from cube to cube; just as ideas, originally thought of as fixed and immutable, become fluid and linked with cooperation and communication.  Viewers participate in creating this movement, and interact with the piece by working together to move the smaller joystick, causing the larger piece to move in a similar fashion.  Coordinated movement is rewarded with fire and lighting effects.  At night, poofers dance in the sky as golden images move on the playa surface below.",

At sunset everything transforms. The field morphs, bursting into a sea of light reacting to movement and mimicking the fluid almost pulsing nature of the sun's corona. \r\n\r\nLike in the chromosphere, a magnetic sunspot has informed the pattern of rods, creating patches of pure brightness and areas as mysterious as the inner working of this great star. Zones of tranquillity where the world outside has been blocked out, enable you to lie in a sea of energy, life and light. \r\n\r\nSwirling lights blur the line between playa and art breaking down the boundaries of this once unfathomable celestial being.",

Standing more than three stories tall, it beckons to passersby with the promise of shade and adventure, conjuring spontaneous communities out of desert sand and sun.\r\n\r\nAt night, LEDs hidden within each leaf begin to glow. The 15,000 leaves form a dome-shaped \"canvas of light\" that towers over the playa, spanning more than a thousand square feet. Participants lying under the tree experience sublime light shows set to ambient music or live performance. And they directly influence the canopy lights through their sounds and biorhythms, creating moments of transcendent oneness with each other and with nature.",

    "description": "Guided by the sun, the Dung Bug will adventure across the dust on its daily ritual of spawning new friendships and shared experiences by utilizing a unique and a highly interactive human gerbil ball propulsion system. \r\n\r\nSimilar to a children's tricycle, the 10' diameter Dung Ball is rolled forward by the walking weight of participants riding inside and is steered by an experienced bug pilot operating a pivot between the front and back wheels. The tessellated surface of the Dung Ball isn't exactly round and in combination with kinetic legs the bug has an articulated and lifelike movement as it clunkily moves along the playa. At night, the bug will utilize pixel-mapped LED lighting and starcaster lights to illuminate its travel path and inner workings. The starcaster lights are a nod to how wild dung beetles use the moon, stars, and Milky Way to safely travel in the dark.",

Pre-hispanic melodies converge with experimental sounds and techniques to accompany the breath and silence of the Black Rock Desert. You will be sonically immersed in an ever-oscillating universe reaching for balance. As dusk approaches, Aluna will be illuminated by hundreds of LED lights that line its frame and body, reflecting and challenging the sounds of Aluna, creating a complete interactive experience for Participants.",

This takes folks to a coal-seam inspired room presenting a panorama of a Carboniferous rainforest. Letters about hope for the future of Appalachia (written during the February 2017 Frostburn Regional) are featured. At night, LEDs illuminate the entire piece. \r\n\r\nAt dusk and dawn, a 20 minute film edit of the film \"Margaret\" (1990) by John McCormick will be projected, featuring stories from the life of a Korean-American kid thriving in Appalachia. (Preview here: https://youtu.be/mOxy18EJOE8 ). \r\n\r\nPhase II: the installation is set on fire by a man wearing large orange angel wings at dawn on Saturday.

It has seven levels that reach 35 ft. high, each level with projecting decorative wings encircling it. \r\n\r\nFrom a distance, the wings create a feeling of lightness, while the dome as a whole conveys a rooted presence. Participants enter the Temple through one of thirteen sizable inverted \"V\" openings. Inside is a welcoming, vaulted, airy interior defined by a series of shrinking, concentric circles soaring overhead. The dome top is left uncovered to allow for the participant's connection with the cosmos. The open interior design incorporates hundreds of shelves lining every wall, as well as several freestanding sub-altars that provide many niches and ledges for objects of remembrance.",

    "description": "A \"Chicken and Egg Situation\" is one where it is impossible to say which of two things happened first or caused the other to happen. This installation, featuring both chicken and eggs, takes the traditional riddle and turns it into a giant art object focused on the immediate experience of play. It has a smooth curvilinear metal framework in the shape of a huge chicken, with a cage of tubular steel hoops forming the body and a large circular opening at the rear, which Burners climb into via a ladder. Inside there is a pile of gigantic leather-covered foam eggs that they can lie on and hug and frolic about in. The activities of the Participants themselves turn the installation into performance art. Aesthetically it is a shape of great purity and simplicity, emphasizing the ovoid and symbolising fertility. The artwork is the creative expression of a paradox that has exercised philosophers and scientists for centuries \u2013 Which came first, the chicken or the egg?",

To be transported again, to have a sense of adventure. Participants enter and exit through an opening under one of the wings. Inside the body is a cozy space with high ceilings and a single spiral staircase that journeys through childhood memories. The walls are set-designed to take them back in time and travel through school years as they climb. At the height of the stairs are two ladders for access to and from the top. It is here where they find the focal point - a sweeping view of the playa through M\u00facaro's giant eyes that move with its head as it rotates.",

In the belief that change is the only constant grace given to Humankind, to embrace it in all ways is the only way to brighten our evolution.

It is made kinetic by the use of suspension springs taken from trucks. The suspension springs are placed about half way up each of the tubular structures, allowing the top pieces of the sculpture to sway and move in the wind or when touched by people. Lights shining up from within the sculpture along with the moving parts create an ethereal essence. The natural forms rise up from the playa, reaching through, and swaying in the wind. This piece is about the organized functionality of living organisms, in contrast with the disorganization and sometimes seemingly chaotic physical world considered to be reality.",

He is not a male or a female entity \"he or she\" is both. The statue will be illuminated at night with (projection mapping) projectors.\r\n\r\n The projection mapping will be focusing on the chakras situated along the body of the statue.  This visualization will be a beautiful reflection of chakras and their auras and the subtle understanding of the energy centers. It will have many meanings for many people. But its main objective is to reflect on the self.",
