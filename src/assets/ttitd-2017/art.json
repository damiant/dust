The acrylic panels contain designs evocative of our shared experience on the playa.  These designs may include elements of such radical rituals as seeing the sun rise behind a temple, being caught in a dust storm, and dancing to incredible music only heard once anywhere in the world.\r\n\r\nDuring the darker hours, a system of flex sensors, micro-controllers, and LEDs will bring the wind to life.  With calm wind, the structure will gently pulse in different colors and shifting patterns.  When the wind picks up, the lights will appear to \"flow\" with the direction of the wind, and the patterns and colors will move more quickly and intensely with more vivid colors.",

Allowing the spectator to become aware of this leads to the realization of previous ignorance.\r\n\r\nIn my research trip to Amsterdam I was able to talk to prostitutes that operate in the RLD. Hearing their opinions on how \"the windows\" concept results in psychological effects on the client.

    "description": "Drawing inspiration from iconic British candy, Odd Jelly Out depicts a joyous gathering of 20 oversized Jelly Babies formed from steel and painted polyurethane. Despite their humor and charm, these brightly colored, misshapen Babies collectively hold up a mirror to those who stumble upon and wander through their celebration. Some chatter, some canoodle, some whoop, some are overwhelmed and some feel as though they don't belong at the party at all. While the Babies' collective placement in deep playa reflects the isolation of being on the fringes of society, Odd Jelly Out is testament both to the artist's warm nostalgia for her native Britain, and the childhood ritual of daily, post-school visits to the sweetshop.",

Cables descending from the top of the cone carry 3600 individually controlled LEDs. Inside the cone are interactive widgets constructed mostly out of repurposed objects. Manipulating the widgets causes patterns of light to appear and move across the LEDs. Spinning wooden wheels causes stripes to move around the cone and collide to create seemingly random combinations of color.

Sometimes water is the agent of change, wearing down the edges and smoothing over the brittleness of its natural state. Other times stone is worn by centuries of human footsteps, traveling the long roads to market, to worship, to home.  The tops of these tables are ancient granite stair blocks; their worn surfaces bear witness to 600-900 years of architectural service.   Collected and re-purposed, these blocks are crafted into useful objects meant to sit at the heart of human exchange. \r\n\r\nRhodes adds, \"Like much of my work, Lithic Altars sit at the crossroads of architecture and sculpture.

It is believed that if you fold a thousand origami cranes, the universe will grant you a wish. We chose to build a giant crane (Coco) in the style and tradition of origami; so wherever it went it would bring with it the spirit and the energy of peace and wellness.\r\n\r\nAscension (Coco), is a 150 ft wide and 45 ft tall giant white origami crane made of aluminum truss, white fabric, and tension wire. The aluminum structure is modular, making the crane a temporary installation, but completely mobile. The 100+ components and over 7000 sf of 80% mesh texilene sunshade material, that make up the crane, can be dismantled and shipped in one 40 ft shipping container.",

On the two opposite sides leading into the entrances, there's a candle-lit red carpet, with guiding ropes, hanging bells & chimes. Pews, facing the confessional, invite onlookers to see into the grid panels on the confessional, to view the silhouettes of those inside. Inside, participants sit facing a writing scroll, to write their confession on, sharing their beauty of truth. It will be humbling to enter the booth, and as one sits down to write, or speaks to the silhouette of the confessor across from them, they will not only see a blank slate, but also see how many others sat in the same place before them, filling the wound up scroll with their innermost secrets, seeking absolution and freedom.",

    "description": "Why an installation like a wall? Why call it the \"KAFKA 9.0\"? \r\n\r\nBecause it's a wall, it protects all round, and a wall, even if it seems hard, lends itself to clear vision, both near and far, dominant but not invasive, it envelops without being claustrophobic. \r\n\r\nWhy Kafka? Because with his famous metamorphosis, is pure Alchimia, is the transformation of material into material, and with art it transforms soul into soul. \r\nIt's a passage, a conversation, a way to achieve full knowledge of oneself, and therefore full freedom. \r\n\r\nArt is knowledge, and as such, has to be able to be communicated and have an emotional impact on man, providing food for thought processes and feelings that become a journey, and that's how art transforms, like Alchemy, an Alchemic ritual. \r\nThe installation consists of a decagon with a diameter of about 10m* made up of wooden posts with slanted supports and horizontal planks that, attached at preset heights, support the wooden structures on which to place the art.",

    "description": "Planting the Seeds of Man's Becoming - In this ritual it is our role to dream the world into being.  In a belief that thought begets matter, this ceremony gives us an opportunity to imagine an amelioration of the \"Man\" of the future.  What is his greatest potential? What would his leadership be like?  How will he be?   -This shrine is built in honor of ancient wisdom teachings of the Andes in the form of a Ayni Despacho - a sacred care package is created for Mother Earth in gratitude for sacred reciprocity to all that exist.  Symbolic organic offerings are part of the sculpture and consist of mountains for places of power/wisdom, Ouroboros spiral for the perpetual cyclic renewal of life and infinity, sweets for Love, bark for plant relatives, raisins for ancestors, anise for celebration/sensuality and various raw material. A ritual feeding in the form of seed replicas will be placed on the shrine for citizens of Black Rock City to imbue their intention of Man's Becoming . . .",

    "description": "The Story Behind\r\nIn December 2016, a tragic attack hit near one of the memorial places in Berlin at Gedächtniskirche (Church of Memory in the center of the city). A man drove a heavy lorry into the crowded Christmas market. Twelve women and men came to death, others were heavily injured. This incident (which happened near to most of us living in Berlin) inspired us to develop the Shrine of Lost Moments as an art project at Burning Man 2017.\r\n\r\nThe Project\r\nWe all have periods, relationships, or people in our lives that either end or disappear too early, that we have no time to say farewell to or process, or things that we want to end and can’t. Giving these transitions an active place of remembrance and farewell, as a place of transition;\r\nwe want to create the shrine of lost moments at Burning Man 2017. The lost moment might also be a period or person that you want to embrace and bring back into memory.\r\n\r\nThe visitor of the shrine is encouraged to interact and engage: he or she takes a colored piece of cardboard – the Remembrance Piece. This piece is cut in the form of the tower of the Berlin’s Gedächtniskirche (memorial church) and contains the shadow of a person (inspired\r\nby the shadow of vaporized victims of the Hiroshima-bombing).\r\n\r\nPeople can take one of the remembrance pieces and write a name, life period, situation… they want to remember, embrace or eliminate from their lives. Both positive and burdening memories are welcome. Then, the remembrance piece can be broken in two parts – a little bit\r\nlike the identity tag (dog tag) that soldiers carry around their necks when on a mission. The upper part stays with the burner; the lower part will be placed at the shrine – designed as a colorful “tree of life.” The tree of life will be burned with the attached Remembrance Pieces together with the Man.",

You can imagine the rest... Yes! it´s a miracle!

Many openings are for notes and prayers, and interior for small relics from the public.\r\nIn Native American culture, the four arrows at the cardinal points in a circle are all pointing inwards. The circle represents the world and also an individual.

Scientists must envision and study unimaginable forces, distances, and time spans.  Thus a leap of faith through rationality extends experience beyond the realm of our normal senses.  We will show citizens that interstellar radiation has been continually bombarding their own body though beyond their awareness.  The goal of this effort is to engage the Playa explorer with the playful interaction of \"catching\" a cosmic ray; seeing its path through their body. Our desire is to move beyond experiential-based rationality into a more fundamental contemplation of vast scales of time and space and thereby surrender to a realization of our own insignificance.   And if we are insignificant what is the role of our uniqueness and our belief in sacred things? ?  Isn't it absurd to be simultaneously unique and yet totally insignificant?",

The artists of the Logical Phallusy Collective will change the sculpture’s story at least every 12 hours. Suggestions from the denizens of the playa will be solicited for new stories. We want to provide the medium for people to express their thoughts and ideas with phalluses. The entire wall will be mounted within a steel “A-frame” structure and guy-lined down. The structure is very stable even with minimal intrusions into the soil due to the inherent stability of the frame​;​ the perforations in the steel panels ​make them able to swing to ​sluff off high wind.

The material of the art is carved plaster of Paris, primed with a glossy finish.  \r\n\r\nThe figures are under 6 feet high allowing them to be touched, walked around, and examined.  There are four benches around the art allowing Black Rock City citizens to sit, gather, discuss the art, or just relax on their journey across the Playa.  \r\n\r\nI would hope the piece sparks discussion on being your true self, to open up to all aspects of life and what it has to offer.  In short, to come out of the corner you may be in and stand in the light of life.  Feel your Bliss.",

Automatons (or automata if there are more than one) have been around for centuries. The art of animating human or animal form has fascinated mankind since before the birth of Christ.\r\n\r\nThere is a personal catalyst in bringing our animal automata to the Playa.  One of our artist's brothers died young when he was overcome with cancer related to AIDS. He was a fantastic person and brought so much joy the lives of so many others. One of his most prized possessions included a collection of wooden automata animals.  \r\n\r\nIt is in his memory, and with great joy that we bring these pieces to life in Black Rock City.  The automata will be large interactive sculptures that poke fun at and bring life to the radical rituals of animal playfulness and pleasure.  Five or six free range animals will round out the menagerie.",

A 20 foot length of steel pipe acts as the sounding box, while a theramin antenna at the end controls a series of electromagnets that actuate a strand of piano wire within.  It is designed to be minimal and unassuming, while still having an intriguing presence. Participants will be drawn in by its form, and only upon closer inspection will they discover something completely unexpected and wonderful. As they get close to or reach out to touch the end of the pipe, they will notice a soft musical sound starting to emit. If they move their hand closer to the antenna, the pitch of the sound will rise, and as they move their hand away the pitch will fall. The experience will be the interface of a traditional theramin, but with a more real, physical sound.",

We ask Participants to send their purest intentions into the water of our artwork. Samples of the water will be sent to Massaru Emoto Institute where they will perform the water crystal photography.\r\n\r\nThis project intends to create a pure interaction between the water and people. The photos of the water crystals will show the blueprint of the energy field of intentions sent to that water during the week. Embodying the spirit of Burning Man, Friday and Saturday night, we will be utilizing the transformational properties of fire. We will ignite a flame that dances inside the water vortex burning and releasing all collected intentions of the water and offering them into the cosmos.",

From any angle other than the apex viewpoint, the piece appears as separate geometric parts, reducing in size from one end to the other.  From a single viewing position, all pieces of the image align to create a flat, unified portrait of the Hindu deity Ganesha.\r\n\r\nIn Hindu tradition, Ganesha is the deity tasked with removing obstacles and creating good fortune.  As powerful as faith can be, however, most obstacles will not be overcome by faith alone.  It requires some level of human intervention.  This often requires a willingness to look at the problem from multiple different perspectives.  Once you have examined the impediment from varying points of view, the path forward becomes much clearer.",

From dust, we give people the stars. Here at the Observatory we seek to expand both mind and soul. Here we show off the stars, tell stories from ages past that give the constellations their names. Here we teach of meteorites and pass them from hand to hand. Here we discuss science in all its forms and weave a tapestry of how and where and why that enlightens and inspires. And what is that, if not the very core of art?\r\n \r\nOur main telescope is a Dobsonian with a 20\" mirror, larger than many permanent public observatories. The smaller scopes are only smaller by comparison; they, too are possessed of relatively large mirrors. Nothing can prepare the soul for the endless beauty of the universe.",

It is the fusion of music and light in an enclosed space.  Its inherent interactivity allows the citizens of Black Rock City to become the composer of their own visual experience.  It's a place to be amazed at the art, but also as an amazing part of one's journey through the playa.  The enclosed environment completely engulfs you in a world of interactive light patterns & full-surround sound.  Play with it and watch how your fellow citizens express themselves, or even create a shared experience!",

Varying in height a few feet over head, the rings rhythmically pulse, dim, and color shift. Dusty denizens stroll through the field of light.\r\n\r\nAmbient ethereal sound filters through the air, layered NASA space recordings: interstellar plasma whirls, lightning from Jupiter, deep-bass starlight waves, Saturn's melodic hum.    \r\n\r\nThree microphones stand ready, adding human voice to the mix. As people sing, speak or whisper into the mics, the hovering illuminated rings respond, matching color and intensity to vocal rhythms. \r\n\r\nAs midnight nears, people patiently watch the horizon, as each of the Big Dipper's seven stars slowly glides into center-point alignment inside the illuminated rings. Midnight ritual ensues: a learned astronomer opens minds and hearts to cosmic wonder in a guided meditative tour of the night sky.",

In ritual that stretches back before humans – and that also anticipates a future when they don't exist – the sidhe revel in the endless cycle of light and dark. The court bursts from the Otherworld, and bystanders see a dark figure with pulsing veins of red light and a silver face that reflects a person's soul, followed by cavorting figures who tap on many drums. \r\n\r\nIn caricature of the Pied Piper leading children astray, some of the sidhe beat a march, while other figures dart among onlookers, drawing bystanders in as the group strides toward ritual stations of drum and light. The court – and its new attendants – pound a rhythm as the sun sinks below the horizon towards the inevitable transformation of light to dark. The sidhe and its new court howl in joy as the sun drops past the skyline, and the blessed cool of night bathes the land in its embrace.",

Sometimes crossing a bridge happens as a rite of passage.  Sometimes one is stuck forever at a door that never opens, grieving for a dream that is never granted. However there is always the eternal return to the bridge, an endless yearning to travel across into a better, brighter place.  We are like plants in the soil that always strive to reach for the sun.\r\n\r\nTHE CAGE stages the fact that we're trapped by profound ignorance and limited cognitive capacity. We're trapped by our need for absolute  good and evil. Our human choices lead us into vulnerability and into natural disaster. We are surprised at our suffering, when this is history of the world.",

    "description": "Burning Man is like its own little world, a universe of potentiality and creativity. This piece approaches the cosmological understanding of creation and being as viewed through the lens of Plato's Timaeus, wherein the Demiurge (or Craftsperson) is understood for transforming ideas (Ideals) into reality. Just as the Demiurge created the universe, so will Participants in this installation be able to help create a facet of the Burning Man reality and world by interacting with a display that shifts in various modes of communication (symbols, colors, movement) relative to movement. Both the installation and the Participants will evolve and change as a result of each other, creating a microcosm of a universal approach towards growth and creativity. \r\n\r\nThe installation is comprised of three major parts: a canvas of changing colors that represents the collective unconscious, the dynamically-changing display inspired by the Mind, and the sensors wherein participants interact in reality.",

The kittens will act out scenes and images of life, traditional tarot cards, while other cards will be more abstract and may not involve kittens directly.

    "description": "Public participation is part of the power of Pinhole Project. Our photographic process is a community event. We empower users to collaborate on the composition and exposure often serving as models and composers of the photographic product.  One person sets up the scene, someone times the exposure, everyone holds for 40 to 120 seconds and another records the exposure time, location, and time of day for prosperity. \r\n\r\nThe barrel cameras next travel their way back to our Desert Darkroom. In Illumination Village, a storage container is transformed into a full wet photographic darkroom  where the playa magic continues. \r\n\r\nWe will be building and supporting a Playa Gallery located in Illumination Village once again this year, displaying our Art as it is created by our project and developed in our Desert Darkroom!",

    "description": "Inspired by vintage Las Vegas casino signs and a healthy sense of irony, the BORING sign is a 18-foot tall, 20-foot long reminder to never take one's self – or one's life work – too seriously. The sign itself is made out of reclaimed sheet metal and discarded letters from dismantled corporate signs, hand painted, lit by 300 ten-watt incandescent bulbs and securely attached to a welded base with wheels (and sometimes, pedal-power) so the piece is fully mobile across the playa. You can usually find the BORING sign accompanying burns, alongside popular art projects, and framing the silhouette of the Man at sunset. With four 500-watt speakers and a playlist of danceables from the 60s, 70s and 80s, the mobile, rolling sign often attracts an entourage of sunset or late night boogie revelers.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/campboring.",

Each television will play an original film with the through line of or theme of Radical Ritual.

You realize that the Tower is a traveling time capsule that fosters communication.  It has traveled to eight different events in the North East United States.  Each side has a different personality.  You mount the Tower and quickly get engrossed in the art and the prose.  You notice that there is a little bin of colored markers.  You grab one and carry it with you as you wander up and around the Tower, waiting for that inspirational message to spark a reaction.

    "description": "\"Interspecies Communication,\" is an interactive kinetic-musical-sculpture of metal birds and fish, and was inspired by the idea of spontaneous group behavior. From the unprompted assembly of molecules that led to life, to the behavior of social communities, the ability for an individual to react to change through the influence of those around it contributes to a spontaneous behavior of a larger group without a single leader. \r\n\r\nAs Participants climb onto the sculpture and cause it to move and to sound, their influence on each other, in combination with the sense of interspecies communication inherent in causing the bird to sing, creates a spontaneous ritual behavior that leads to group cohesion. Like a bird murmuration and a school of fish, the forms of the sculpture (made up of smaller bird and fish forms) hint at the remarkable ability of many individuals to maintain cohesion as a group in highly uncertain environments and with limited, noisy information.",

These unsuspecting chrononauts are going wherever and whenever the time machine takes them next. Their collections and stashes of pseudoscientific clutter contain clues to solving a sci-fi mystery representative of the anti-ritual, the unfounded, and unexplainable.

As you make your way around fallen trusses towards a mysterious altar in the middle of the structure, you'll see threatening clouds and an offering to the gods of industry, along with the handle to a mysterious crank that could have something to do with a kinetic automaton.  What happens when you turn the crank?  Why has industry sucked all color and sound out of this place?  \r\n\r\nOnce the clouds part and a giant finger has accepted or rejected the offering, faint music starts to play and lights start to shine out of the slats in a garage at the back of the structure.  Drawn to the light, you walk towards it and notice that things start to have color and substance.  Entering the garage, you will find a replica of the original oscillator used in the soundtrack to Fantasia, and learn about the founding of Silicon Valley.",

    "description": "House of doG is a chapel honoring the animal companions who have become an integral part of our lives, both past and present. Styled in the manner of a chapel one can find on the side of the street in the Chihuahuan Desert with Dia de los Muertos design, House of doG is a space to remember, pray, and give thanks for our beloved animal friends. Here, much like the Temple, people can participate by posting or writing about their animal relationship, confer and share stories with other travelers to this sacred site, or sip on some tequila in remembrance. Mexican culture is heavily laden with honoring and celebrating the lives of the past that came before to create what the present. It is also heavily Catholic, and to add an absurd twist the saints that will watch over this space will have the bodies of humans, but the heads of animals, as if St. Francis of Assisi became so in tune with them he became one.",

It goes dark, pulses & glows again.\r\n\r\nA central, pew-like hexagon with devotional texts is an invitation to kneel. The open texts contain series of colored dots in rows, corresponding to colored buttons. Pressed in sequence, lights darken, then begin to rise up the columns.\r\n\r\nTurning pages, pressing buttons, each page a ritual of motion necessary to light the shrine. For each 'ritual' the lights respond differently. Participants each control 1/6 of the lights. Working together, the intricacy of pattern increases. Combining sequences unlocks more colors & patterns. \r\n\r\nWhile not intended to represent any one form of worship, it contains elements of many. Faith, religion & spirituality are all related, a veneration of the source of the light that allows us to see the Universe around us.",

Old resentments can consume large amounts of life force just in the act of holding them in a stuck clenching pattern. This participatory installation will offer a safe and sacred space for pilgrims to be invited to shed obsolete patterns of all kinds. where in our world are we invited to behave this way? Usually these emotions are held invisibly on purpose, or else surface in unconscious ways. \r\n\r\nThis altar provides a permissive environment to expose oneself, privately or publicly, and even be encouraged to go deeper into exploring and letting go of resentments or attachments, things we once needed as coping mechanisms, but are now obsolete, yet we may never have purged them from our brain's hard drive. Time to clear space for new healing, new life force and space for new inspirations and ways of being in the world.",

The fairy shrimp are constructed of rip-stop nylon, and float affixed to bamboo poles. The individual sculptures are around 12' long and 4' in diameter. They represent the very real and very tiny creatures underfoot. They emerge here to dance in unison with the wind.  When there is no wind, there is rest, and maybe some slight shade. Here is existence of a temporary nature - as fairy shrimp: to eat, to dance, to mate, and to enjoy each other's company before our pool dries up, again.",

Moving closer, Black Rock City citizens find their mirror reflections multiplied and fractalized by the convex outer surface of the portal. \r\n\r\nEntering the convex inner portal, citizens find their reflection rearranged and compressed creating a cubist self-portrait. Inside the portal a hallucinatory audio collage designed to complement the citizens's mirror mosaic reflection runs nonstop during the event.

On top of the portal 3 wind vanes turn in opposite directions creating a flurry of irrelevant motion signifying nothing.",

Sound elements conjure a sense of primordial place; the dry lakebed, the playa.

We are trying to make a way for that same energy to be expressed in 12 to 14 different locations around Black Rock City this year.

    "description": "If you were waiting for a sign, this is it. \r\n\r\nGiving new light to the term street art, these subtle yet striking  public displays of awareness offer a series of connected and thought-provoking messages on industrial traffic signs immersed throughout the playa . The signs foster the ethos of global consciousness with wise words, connected statements, and enlightening messages that promote positive thought and inspire an inner dialogue. The beauty of these installations is that it is for everyone: public art in its purist form; a series of affirmations- relevant to all of us, applicable on so many levels. It is the intent that everyone on their unique journeys will have an opportunity to be touched by a seemingly serendipitous message. All people – no matter how divergent their concerns, no matter how fragile or empowered they are – will be able to experience it and perhaps, receive the message they needed to see.\r\n \r\n\"Art is only real when shared.\".",

It can be as simple as touching a few keys or as complex as composing a song or playing an étude. The melodies and light that come from HEARDT engage both the player and the audience, bringing about a shared art experience.

Throughout the Sierra Nevada, species of pine trees are dying, compromised by a bark beetle which has proliferated due to human interruption of the cycle of forest fires, and climate change. The material of these trees, donated to our project, harvested and milled, becomes the basic building block of the Temple. Interlocking timber pieces in formation become a Temple that is both cloud and spire; inverted pyramidal columns suggest the negative-space of a forest canopy, simultaneously supporting a vast pagoda-like 'cloud' framework which in turn supports a central spire. In this way disorder gives way to harmony, and a group of dying trees is re-ordered into a cathedral of timbers stretching toward the sky; filtered sun rays will illuminate the intricate work of hundreds of hands building in unison; a collaboration that knits together a community as roots intertwine to give a healthy forest stability.",

Upon nearing, it becomes clear that the piece is in sinuous and seductive motion, and that the movements are interconnected from cube to cube; just as ideas, originally thought of as fixed and immutable, become fluid and linked with cooperation and communication.  Viewers participate in creating this movement, and interact with the piece by working together to move the smaller joystick, causing the larger piece to move in a similar fashion.  Coordinated movement is rewarded with fire and lighting effects.  At night, poofers dance in the sky as golden images move on the playa surface below.",

At the top of the tower is a 21\" diameter ball of LEDs - the beacon.\r\n\r\nThe canopy is a 6-pointed star, 52' in diameter.  It is composed of 48 equilateral triangular panels, each made of bird netting, 1/8\" wire rope, special triangular shackles, and 450 LED modules.  It hovers 10' high at the edges, 15' high in the middle - a curved dome.  Each of the 21,600 full-color LED modules is individually controlled by an iPad app, creating a very large, low-resolution video display.\r\n\r\nSurrounding the tower are 6 smaller aluminum towers called pylons.  Each of these is attached to one point of the star-shaped canopy.  New for 2017 are aluminum plates on each side of each pylon, which reflect the light from the canopy in pleasing ways.",

    "description": "Light Years Away is a naturally and supernaturally inspired interactive sculpture. It is a representation of the boundary between the plane of existence and that which lies beyond. That plane is punctuated by a symbol of a powerful natural force, the vortex. This vortex is a doorway through which one can send their thoughts and prayers. It is a shrine, an altar, an homage to spirituality and the rituals that connect us.\n\nLight Years Away has a powerful presence. It is tall and covers a large space. It is geometry, numerology, spirituality, chaos, and nature. It is an homage to the vortex and a harnesser of its mighty power. It is a vessel for hope and grief. Through it one can confess and pray. One can remember and forget. One can whisper a secret or yearn for release. It is a tool for all. It is a tool for many. It is a doorway for all the sadness. For all the hope. It is for us to wield, and for us to revel in, as it is both a doorway to the other side and a doorway into ourselves.",

    "description": "A \"Chicken and Egg Situation\" is one where it is impossible to say which of two things happened first or caused the other to happen. This installation, featuring both chicken and eggs, takes the traditional riddle and turns it into a giant art object focused on the immediate experience of play. It has a smooth curvilinear metal framework in the shape of a huge chicken, with a cage of tubular steel hoops forming the body and a large circular opening at the rear, which Burners climb into via a ladder. Inside there is a pile of gigantic leather-covered foam eggs that they can lie on and hug and frolic about in. The activities of the Participants themselves turn the installation into performance art. Aesthetically it is a shape of great purity and simplicity, emphasizing the ovoid and symbolising fertility. The artwork is the creative expression of a paradox that has exercised philosophers and scientists for centuries – Which came first, the chicken or the egg?",

To be transported again, to have a sense of adventure. Participants enter and exit through an opening under one of the wings. Inside the body is a cozy space with high ceilings and a single spiral staircase that journeys through childhood memories. The walls are set-designed to take them back in time and travel through school years as they climb. At the height of the stairs are two ladders for access to and from the top.

It is made kinetic by the use of suspension springs taken from trucks. The suspension springs are placed about half way up each of the tubular structures, allowing the top pieces of the sculpture to sway and move in the wind or when touched by people. Lights shining up from within the sculpture along with the moving parts create an ethereal essence. The natural forms rise up from the playa, reaching through, and swaying in the wind.

    "description": "Bodhi (Sanskrit: बोधि; and Pali) translated into English with the word enlightenment, although its literal meaning is closer to \"awakening.\" \r\n\r\nThe Bodhi project: \r\n\r\nBuilding an 8 to 10 feet statue of a human being sitting in a meditative posture. This Human entity  \"he or she\"  has a multi attribute of spiritual, religious, mathematical or scientific connectivity.\r\n\r\n\"He or she\" is representing our potential for spiritual and mathematical expansion of our mind, but also the deep understanding of the self. He is not a male or a female entity \"he or she\" is both. The statue will be illuminated at night with (projection mapping) projectors.\r\n\r\n The projection mapping will be focusing on the chakras situated along the body of the statue.  This visualization will be a beautiful reflection of chakras and their auras and the subtle understanding of the energy centers. It will have many meanings for many people. But its main objective is to reflect on the self.",
