We've become skilled at recognizing when people are ready to change direction, and helping them dig out and uncover ideas about what those new directions might look like.\r\n\r\nMagic and ritual use a combination of physical, emotional, and mental transformations that work. They've been developed and tested for tens of thousands of years, across every culture known to man, and keep converging on the same basic methods *because* they work. While modern culture provides many benefits - ready access to food, to health care, to shelter, to conveniences and entertainment and distraction - those same benefits can separate us from the flow of life that we originally evolved within. Magic and ritual seem so powerful to modern humans precisely because, for the most part, they have never experienced them directly.\r\n\r\nLet's fix that.",

To envision and prepare the world of tomorrow we need to rewire our nervous systems and free ourselves from the old paradigm. Tantra is an accelerator of evolution. The context of Burning Man serves as an amplifier to these ancient Tantric techniques. The collective ambition towards freedom present during Burning Man is unique. It erases differences between individuals and supports the Tantric effort of transcending all false dualities. From regular morning energetic practices to one-of-a-kind ceremonies and ritual, Tantra Mantra embraces and promotes the change towards a new human agreement.

Over the next 5 years, we will be investigating each of these strange lands, then reconvening back here to tell of our adventures.\r\n\r\nWhile our travels instilled in us a breadth of knowledge, the catharsis of adventure has left us with a desire to share our experiences with the world. Through workshops, lectures, performances, and merry making, our mission is to educate you in the ways of these 5 mysterious and foreign lands.  In addition to daily and nightly events, we will also be serving food and drink which we have discovered along the way.  And what of your travels?  Do you have stories to share with us?  Read through our story books, then add your own tales to be incorporated into our ever growing lore.",
