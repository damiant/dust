They've been developed and tested for tens of thousands of years, across every culture known to man, and keep converging on the same basic methods *because* they work. While modern culture provides many benefits - ready access to food, to health care, to shelter, to conveniences and entertainment and distraction - those same benefits can separate us from the flow of life that we originally evolved within.

When we pursue the light we use movement, the senses, sensuality, sexuality and connection.  This beckons us in and brings the light of awareness back into the bodies we have vacated. We are particularly interested in the seat of power and intention housed in our bodies. To go there fully requires confronting our shadows.

Rather than being a performance in which the audience listens to musicians, it is a participatory spiritual practice in which everyone is encouraged to sing and express their inner joy.\r\n\r\nThe Sacred Song Teahouse is a Burning Man camp dedicated to creating and maintaining a serene temple oasis for joining our voices and diving into the Divine... together. We welcome the keepers of tea wisdom to join us in our temple space to sooth our throats with their mystical infusions.

The context of Burning Man serves as an amplifier to these ancient Tantric techniques. The collective ambition towards freedom present during Burning Man is unique. It erases differences between individuals and supports the Tantric effort of transcending all false dualities. From regular morning energetic practices to one-of-a-kind ceremonies and ritual, Tantra Mantra embraces and promotes the change towards a new human agreement.
