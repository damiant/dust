Imagine that you can FEEL the expression of music with your body. Shed of your clothes, you lay prone and robbed of your sense of sight, one of our artists will perform upon your body with the music in ways that you have never experienced. This is a unique and creative custom designed sensory performance. Not for the faint of heart. Eros Tangeré is a one on one, sensual adult event. Space is very limited so signing up for a session prior to start time is highly recommended.

Six years ago we completely redesigned the machine for even greater intensity and enjoyment, and gave it a new name: The Orgasamator. When you visit, you will be in a private room with an operator who is experienced, very sensitive to your needs and concerns, who listens well and is deeply dedicated to giving you an amazing experience. Your specific needs and desires will be discussed at the beginning, and the experience will be fine-tuned to give you exactly what you want. No penetration is involved, but sexy talk and sensual touch are available options. We want everyone to feel refreshed and respected when they leave. We are strongly focused on cleanliness and health, along with fun. Come solo, or bring a good friend (male or female) to add another dimension to this deeply immersive and wonderfully personal experience. Wear as much or as little as you would like, you can stop any time if the pleasure becomes too intense. If you are a woman, 18+, the Orgasamator Experience is something you won't want to miss.

Infinite openness awaits your surrender.\r\n\r\nWhen we can separate our desire for sex from our desire to connect intimately, a canvas of possibility emerges in the space between two hearts where we can truly explore intimacy as art.  \r\n\r\nHuman beings need touch, comfort, safety, love, and intimacy in their lives to feel whole, welcome, complete, and content. Attaining the combination of this cocktail of bliss often is only experienced through a sexual relationship of some kind, and rarely are all of these needs met simultaneously, or by the same person. \r\n\r\nOften, along the path to deepening a relationship or flirtatious connection, one partner or the other begins to dabble with sexual energy through flirting, playful touch, sexy talk, innuendo, or other strategies in an effort to shift the situation into an opening for sexual connection and orgasmic release. \r\n\r\nSexual energy is incredibly powerful, playful, blissful, and transformative, yet it can also be overwhelmingly tricky and even deceitful to one's self and others if not stewarded with care. \r\n\r\nThis workshop explores the fine lines between sexuality and intimacy, between loving touch and sexual touch, and between desire to be with someone intimately and the desire to fuck. \r\n\r\nThrough practicing clear and open communication, bringing awareness to the energy in our bodies and intention in our hearts, and by relaxing into the openness of the moment and surrendering any agenda for where it may be leading, the relational space can be transformed into a mysteriously infinite void of possibilities where literally anything can happen. \r\n\r\nCountless women have confided in me that they are frustrated beyond measure by their partner's (or men in general's) inability to be with them in a way that makes them feel safe, free to express their fullness, and feel loved, cherished, and comfortable in their bodies.","event_type":{"label":"Class/Workshop"},"print_description":"Unfucking Sexuality is about decoupling the sex-craving instincts from the desire to connect intimately.

It’s been scientifically proven that the spiritual efficacy of altars is greatly diminished by even trivial amounts of dust. Fortunately, the French Maid Brigade, summoned to task by the BMOrg, is on hand to correct this situation. No matter how much dust your radical ritual kicks up, French Maids will be there to ensure a spiritual journey unencumbered by dust.\r\n\r\nRendezvous with us!

Benjamin facilitates an experience through high energy beats, partner based massage, up-regulating breathwork, Taoist big draws, and awakening energy with the potential to unlock intense mind altering sober psychedelic experiences. Are you curious?\r\n\r\nThe workshop explores embodiment using one-directional partnered massage. Each set of paired individuals will explore what it means to be in their bodies and fully present while receiving one-directional touch from their chosen giver. If an individual can master blocks in their own body, search for releases, discover new methods, or find hidden gems from being present, it creates a foundation of opportunities that can be unleashed. Some benefits to receiving one-directional touch can be:\r\n• Self awareness\r\n• Communication skills\r\n• Desires & goals\r\n• Coping with insecurities\r\n• Decision making\r\n• Shifting mental states\r\n• Letting go (aka release)\r\n• Moving forward\r\n• Opening doors\r\n\r\nHow to prepare:\r\nThis workshop is partner based or can be experienced solo. A crucial consent, boundaries, and communication section will be covered at the beginning. Individuals will have an opportunity to choose a partner. Please be open to same gender pairings. Triad groups are also encouraged, however one person will not be able to receive due to time constraints. This work can include genital or anal touch, but is not required or expected. You can be fully clothed or naked as when you were born. We mention this so you can be comfortable with others choices in a shared space and define your own boundaries.","event_type":{"label":"Class/Workshop"},"print_description":"High energy beats, massage, up-regulating breathwork, Taoist big draws, awakening energy and intense mind altering sober psychedelic experience.","hosted_by_camp":"a1X0V000003HDCHUA4","other_location":"nakedheart","check_location":1,"url":"","occurrence_set":[{"start_time":"2017-09-01T16:30:00-07:00","end_time":"2017-09-01T19:00:00-07:00"}]},{"title":"Preservation of the Mind: Wellbeing Symposium","uid":"21544","description":"Join us for a series of stimulating talks on emotional resilience & self-compassion.

I’ve been ass fucking and blogging my way to pegging princess empowerment for 12 years and want to share my love of all things penetration with you. I LOVE pegging. It makes me feel powerful, sexy, and feminine. I love the view, I love the adoration I get in return, and I love being a part of heightened levels of sexual pleasure for my partner. Pegging need not be about dominating, humiliating, or degrading your partner.  Join me as we leave our fears behind, bring pegging out of the shadows and into the lighter side of kink, and explore safe pegging 101 and beginner equipment. The workshop includes an interactive demonstration, question and answer, and a few surprises.

After conducting 100s of leadership assessments, the firm has been able to scientifically define what good leadership is when it comes to building teams and innovating in the startup environment.\r\n\r\nIn this interactive presentation, Jason, the firm's cofounder, will share some of their discoveries, how leadership can be defined, and most-importantly, how what we learn by co-creating in community turns out to be the exact same skills that leaders are learning at startups.  \r\n\r\nFestivals like Burning Man are more than just a good time—they are a training ground for leaders, community, and innovation. There’s a reason that many startup leaders go to Burning Man and other festivals. \r\n\r\nTogether, we’ll look at what we have already learned about leadership though our community experiences and how to apply those skills to leadership in the default world.  Everyone in the audience will also receive a self-assessment (printed or online) to identify areas that they could improve.","event_type":{"label":"Class/Workshop"},"print_description":"Join Jason Gore in learning about research on startup CEOs, what makes a good leader, and how we can grow as leaders through Burning Man.","hosted_by_camp":"a1X0V000003HDmeUAG","check_location":1,"url":"https://www.neuberggore.com","occurrence_set":[{"start_time":"2017-09-01T11:30:00-07:00","end_time":"2017-09-01T13:00:00-07:00"}]},{"title":"Iced Cold Brew Coffee Cafe","uid":"21793","description":"Up all night?

RAD maintains a list of ritual augmentation providers and pairs them with ritual events.  Attend office hours or just drop on by and ring the bell for service!  And those wanting to join team RAD Services are invited to contact us!  \r\n\r\nWe at RAD Services aren't going to own/produce/design your ritual. We don't loan/gift equipment to you. What we do is show up in person, with our stuff, and augment/decorate your ritual with visual pizzazz and auditory depth!\r\n\r\nHere is a list of some of the services that we provide (some best in low light venues):\r\n\r\n- LED image painting: Image poi, with is a programmable sticks of LEDs, can trace out any image when moved or spun, e.g., fire, lightening, patterns, words, pictures, etc.  Also, these LED props can produce interesting visual affects even when not moved quickly, e.g., flames, fuses, torches, pulsating lights, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n- Sound: We at RAD are able to provide a wide range of mobile audio support, e.g., music for a parade/procession or clear dialog for weddings or other ceremonies. Our electric trike moves the audio with your moving ritual/parade.\r\n\r\n- Fire: Torches, staff, fire ropes, orbs, poi spinning, etc.\r\n\r\n- Video: Front or back lit video projection can help add a new layer of interest to your ritual. You provide the projection surface (e.g., EasyUp side wall) and we bring the equipment.\r\n\r\n- Blinky: Many props to decorate any low light ritual, including: LED poi (dynamic color changes), LED staff (two image poi brought together), LED image poi (see above), fiber optic whips (think swarm of fire flies).\r\n\r\n- Music: Airy Native American flute background music and parade drum cadence music services are available.\r\n\r\nSo, you come up with the ritual and we at RAD help make it even more awesome.

This is a safe, fun way to meet new people who are also participating in Open Relating and to gain some practical tools for your relationship or future relationship(s)!\r\n\r\nTo chose to live and relate in an open or polyamorous way requires a community of like-minded souls. Without community we do not have the necessary support we need as couples and individuals to love as big as our hearts desire.\r\n\r\nWhy we each consciously choose to live in alternative ways then the ones that were passed down to us from earlier generations is very personal. Some do it to increase the variety of sexual partners and others do it as a spiritual path to embrace the light and shadow of opening up.\r\n\r\nThere are many ways to make it work. Some people have stated agreements meanwhile others rely on embodied principles and some are just totally radical. Regardless of your personal preference, most of us were not raised with role models for this alternative way of relating. So we must come together to role model and mirror one another.\r\n\r\nAs the definition and practice of relating is expanding beyond what we were taught unconsciously by our parents we want to invite you to join the conversation. How do you navigate these waters? What have you found that works? Come just to listen and observe or come to participate and add your own thoughts, questions and perspectives into the conversation.\r\n\r\nWe invite you to share what is most alive in your heart and come join the conversation of open relationships where we aim to come together to create a Culture of Conscious Relating.","event_type":{"label":"Class/Workshop"},"print_description":"How to have your cake and eat it too!

After leaving the first new moon of spring behind, we finalised our program and created a daytime/nighttime 12 hours program of our dreams.\r\n\r\n12:00 - 13:00\r\nWe start the day with our community college. We are constantly attracting new roads to explore. We hear friends talk about life changing experiences. We read articles on different ways of life. It leads to so many questions. What is ayahuasca? Should I do Vipassana? Why does Sting love tantric sex? Our community college invites inspirational speakers to provide information on interesting topics. Join this talk, be inspired or just listen to the many wonders of the world.\r\n\r\n13:00 - 14:00\r\nAs we gather in the desert for more than a week, we take the opportunity of this event to ground you, in the desert. Take a moment to step away from the outside world and connect with your home. A beautiful guided meditation accompanied by a celestial communication followed by a cleanse. Not only will this spiritual ceremony set the energy for the rest of our day, it will offer you so much light the rest of the week.\r\n\r\n14:00 - 00:00\r\nAs we slowly move from our spiritual self into our spiritual animal, we've created a musical program to get those who are passing by stop and dance.

Each stool has a different color and colored spots are on the bar, the floor, the monkey bars overhead and even the swings on the edge.  Some stools even have numbers or symbols.

For example, It could be that all people sitting on yellow seats have to go to a blue seat, but they can’t touch the ground, hot lava!  They must climb over and around people, keeping hold of their drinks, of course!  They may have to get a partner and find seats that add up to a certain number.  They may need to have a hand on a certain color and the butts on a different color.  They may have to sit on the bar, hang from the monkey bar, sit on the monkey bar, one foot on a swing, one hand on...the bartender themselves!

There are no points and not even a goal of the game other than to share in the fun and make some new friends!\r\nBartenders wear matching twister-themed outfits and carry super soaker water guns filled with a tasty cocktail.  There is no “bar” in our bar unless you count the monkey bar!  The bartenders roam around the platform, serving our special blend to the patrons.  \r\n \r\nThe GameBar will be open Monday - Saturday 5pm - 9pm for happy hour game time.","event_type":{"label":"Games"},"print_description":"Bar meets board game at the GameBar!

Now, returning from Standing Rock to Black Rock, we come together with global synchronised prayer platform Unify, and cultural force Mayan Warrior, to continue the prayer that started at Standing Rock.\r\n\r\nFor generations, Native American culture has held that the drum is the heartbeat of Mother Earth, and the water, her veins.  Indigenous tribes use drums in various ways to interact with a higher power, known to many as The Great Spirit.  Drums are the channel we use to connect to our spirit, to each other, and to the spirit of Earth. Water is sacred.  MNI WICONI!\r\n\r\nThe historic, global gathering of hundreds of tribes at Standing Rock standing together for the first time for our water has been prophesied for these times.  Now, we gather under the Medicine Wheel of all nations to carry this prayer forward.  It has been said that peace will not come to our Earth until the circle of humanity is complete; until all four colours sit in circle under the Medicine Wheel and share their teachings. \r\n\r\nCome and experience our unification as a human family as we dance together under the Medicine Wheel to the beat of the drum, playing out to all of Black Rock City on the Playa's best sound-system.  Pray with us on the Playa or engage with us online as we stream our prayer out to over 15 million people using Unify's platform. Join us.  Together, we pray for good health and better understanding.  Together, we pray for deep listening.  Together, we pray for unity, for peace, and for love. \r\n\r\nThis is a historic moment you won't want to miss.\r\n\r\nThis is our Radical Ritual.","event_type":{"label":"Ritual/Ceremony"},"print_description":"Join with a drum under the Medicine Wheel Tipi Circle w/First Nations' around sacred fire streaming a prayer into the world w/Unify and Mayan Warrior.","hosted_by_camp":"a1X0V000002rkg5UAA","other_location":"Red Lightning","check_location":1,"url":"http://www.redlightning.org/powerofprayer","contact":"iamaglobalcitizen@gmail.com","occurrence_set":[{"start_time":"2017-08-29T18:30:00-07:00","end_time":"2017-08-29T20:00:00-07:00"}]},{"title":"No Urgency","uid":"22069","description":"The importance of self love and patience as you transition between non monogamous boundaries.

So if no-one's told you, or you haven't noticed yet, men and women are different! Just how different, particularly in sexual response, is only recently being discovered by western science. The famous study of sexuality in the swinging sixties by Masters and Johnson was largely about male sexuality and in a stunning failure of the scientific method they kinda assumed women were pretty much the same......\"\"two arms, two legs, a head, yeah, I think they're pretty much going to react the same way....\"\" without actually finding out until 50/60 years later!\r\n\r\nBut there are and have been more enlightened cultures than ours on these matters. It turns out that some eastern cultures had got a very detailed handle on female sexuality thousands of years ago. Ancient tantric teachings turn out to be not a set of arcane practises based on spiritual mumbo jumbo but precise systems of activating the fullness of the feminine sexual response, now being verified by the latest research in neuroscience in the west.\r\n\r\nWolf calls this range of specific stimulations the Goddess Array, and I shall attempt to describe the steps that every woman needs that men don't need and create a container for you to experience the majority of them in one of Naked Heart's carpeted domes. \r\n\r\nPlease bring nesting materials and a secret gift for your goddess.","event_type":{"label":"Class/Workshop"},"print_description":"What women need, that men don't need, to fully activate sexually.

Many of us have engaged in sensual touch with a lover or tickling at a young age, but are you aware of how well the two can work together to make an amazing sensory experience with someone? Whether it is tickling to tears, to moans of delight, or simply squirming Domme Kelli Lynn Sage and Bagelfather are well versed in this and will be leading this class in sensual touch and the art of tickling with a partner. We have learned the ropes over the years and want to pass our wisdom on to you. We will instruct you, with the help of audience volunteers, in the art of tickling and sensual touch. \r\n\r\nWe will also cover consent, basic bondage, negotiation, safe words, having a positive relationship with kink, as well as touching. This event is for those 18 years old and over (please bring your ID if you look young). People of all gender identities are welcome to attend. It is best if you can come with a partner so you can practice some of what you learn, if you come alone we cannot guarantee to partner you up with someone. We recommend bringing a towel or something similar to lay on the ground to sit on. In addition we ask that you be respectful of all participants and remind you to ask before touching someone that you have not made arrangements before hand.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to volunteer ahead of time email Bagelfather@gmail.com, also feel free to let us know before we start if you are interested in demonstrating.","event_type":{"label":"Mature Audiences"},"print_description":"Learn about the sensual touch and tickling playful to \"mean.\" Please bring something to it on and a partner if you can.

The dome becomes an Ancient temple space. The men then stand in a circle offering unconditional love and healing to the community of women who gather in the center. The women come for healing their trust of the Masculine and to receive their love. This is a hands-off workshop. There is no touching except optional hugging at the end. When men show up and become the pure presence of their Divine Masculine nature and truly witness, then women can relax into their loving Divine Feminine nature and fully become that love.

Each boat is actually a teeter totter, ready to be rocked by the participants. As every craft has environmental sensors installed within, you'll hear incredible, albeit low-key musical tones, as 'played' by the wind, and motion of the boats. The effect is bio-elemental, aural soothing of our minds. Participants will find the interior of the (easily accessible) boats gilded in silver and gold, filled with inspirational quotes to complete the experience. Each ship/shrine has materials to write 'notes of hope' and means of containing these utterances by attendees (Truth be told, these boats act as walk-aboard shrine(s) to inspire Burning Man attendees to leave notes for us to burn off-playa in a ceremony, so their wishes may be granted to the winds after the Burning Man event. ;) The reason for 'Dead Seas' in the title is twofold: the playa's dry lake bed, and the actual Dead Sea in Jordan-- both have high mineral content, that which nourishes souls who 'float' in it. \r\n\r\nThat’s NOT all! ;o)\r\n\r\nThere be CHRISTENINGS, Ye Mateys!

AT has been shown to be an effective tool in preventative medicine, stress-related disorders and panic attacks. It can relieve tension, lessen anxiety, and enhance performance. As the world's first western developed mediation technique, AT is a neurological and psycho-physiological tool or therapy for psychological and medical self-healing. \r\n\r\nAT takes you through a series of validated and prescriptive mental exercises that target specific physiological reactions in the brain and body that underpin optimal health and well-being. Through the power of self-suggestion you are taught how to consciously and intentionally control your Autonomic Nervous System. AT is for anyone who wants to benefit from gaining the self-help tools to manage stress in the present and to develop long term strategies to reduce stress and anxiety. It is also of benefit for qualified or trainee psychotherapists who wish to gain a deeper trust in their relationship with 'self' and for those in the caring professions who want to learn new techniques for self-care. The technique was developed by the German psychiatrist Johannes Heinrich Schultz and first published in 1932. \r\n\r\nEach session can be practiced in a position chosen amongst a set of recommended postures (for example, lying down, sitting meditation, sitting like a rag doll).On a micro level of regeneration, Autogenics retrains cells, glands, the brain and organs to behave as they are ‘meant to’, that is, to work in harmony and to restore the natural order. We are now coming to understand AT’s role in neuro-plasticity, gut health, epigenetic modulation and the placebo response. The future for AT world-wide in becoming a mainstream therapy for the self-regulation of body-mind healing and optimal functioning is exciting!","event_type":{"label":"Class/Workshop"},"print_description":"AT is a powerful, restorative, mind & body technique involving simple relaxation/body awareness exercises to promote stress/anxiety management.","hosted_by_camp":"a1X0V000003HFKSUA4","url":"","occurrence_set":[{"start_time":"2017-08-31T17:00:00-07:00","end_time":"2017-08-31T18:00:00-07:00"}]},{"title":"Shamanic Theatre","uid":"23149","description":"Step beyond the rational and learn to follow your dreams.

After completing all prefoamation rituals to join our Tranfoamation they will shed their old dusty selves and clothing, enter our transfoam chamber, and ascend to the final stage of their actual Transfoamation to oneness with the universe and their fellow human in the transblastive foam experience. \r\n\r\nTransfoamation will take place daily starting on Wednesday and ending on Saturday at 12:00 -1:00pm for children under 13, 1:00 - 4:20pm for all people of all ages. We are usually located near 2:15/G. \r\n\r\nTransfoamation is also the home base of an amazing community that services the city 24 hours a day in a number of ways.  Besides the wonder of a daily personal Transfoamation we offer, the camp serves as the home base of the volunteer professionals working with the Zendo project that provides psychological harm reduction services across the BRC.  We host trainings for Zendo staff in our camp and run a 400 plate per meal kitchen connected to the Transfoamation and Zendo.  We will have a midday hydration area at the exit of our Transfoam Dome run by our camp as well. Also part of the Transfoam camp is the Abraxas Mutant vehicle team.\r\n\r\nOur camp changes it's name every year.

Yet, without a game partner or a certain amount of experience and communication confidence, pegging can be a nerve-wracking adventure.\r\n\r\nButt- Allie is here to help!\r\n\r\nJoin sex and relationship educator (and veteran peg’ster) Allie Moon as she guides you through a laughter-filled and pragmatic workshop that takes you from soup to… er, nuts!\r\n\r\nIn this 2-hour, informative and humorous workshop, where you get to watch, take notes and ask questions, you will learn:\r\n\r\nStrap-On Basics for Women￼\r\nSimple techniques for fun and easy bottoming/receiving\r\nWays to bring up the idea of pegging without freaking out your partners!\r\nCommunication and negotiation skills that will deepen your love life…\r\n* Safer Sex protocols and hygiene tips\r\n* Special considerations when working with butts\r\n* Unique and fun positions perfect for Woman-on-Man sex\r\n* Some simple fem-dom techniques (nothing too scary, we promise!)\r\n* And much, much more!\r\n\r\nShow up with your questions and leave with new-found confidence and self-esteem for your relationships and sex life.","event_type":{"label":"Mature Audiences"},"print_description":"Learn strap-on basics, simple techniques for fun & easy bottoming/receiving, ways to bring up pegging with partners, and much more!

We provide the instruments, the space and the beverages all with the hopes that musicians will come share their special and unique talents with us in a space that fosters musical innovation and cultivates creativity.

Spirit animal is a culturally appropriated term which bastardized an important and significant Native American spiritual practice into white girls calling Lindsay Lohan their spirit animal as she crashes her car drunk with Coke all over her nose. Patronus is the non-offensive Harry Potter originated word that is the animal that forms at the end of your wand to protect against dementors. #themoreyouknow \r\n\r\nNot sure what your Patronus is?

In 2016, Champagne Campaign was first officially placed as a registered theme camp. The universal activity enjoyed by this group of friends is meeting at 12:00 in front of the temple every sunrise for a champagne toast to the new day. This group of friends has continued the sunrise tradition at home in Seattle, and plans sunrise champagne events during the summer. At Burning Man, Champagne Campaign is an interactive camp that hosts daily debates in a campaign-esque setting. Our champagne bar is open during debate hours to encourage lively debates paired with champagne party punch. We encourage lively debates where people are free to give their opinion no matter the absurdity and engage themselves among burners of all different backgrounds and opinions. Champagne Campaign returns to Burning Man in 2017 in that hopes that it will continue to be an interactive inclusive theme camp for years to come on playa as well as in Seattle. All proceeds go to getting our camp to the playa and stocking our bar so we can gift the joy of champagne all week long!","event_type":{"label":"Gathering/Party"},"print_description":"Champagne Campaign is throwing a Patronus Party!

It has become clear to me that sexuality is a fast track to discovering the blind spots which hinder us from intimacy. One of the most fruitful areas of exploration for myself has been in the area of male to male intimacy and gender fluidity. Through my experiences i have found that most men are guarded in ways that protect them from experiencing doubt around their own male sovereignty. For example most of us have been taught that to be affectionate with other males is wrong and means that we are \"\"homosexual\"\" or weak. \r\n\r\nA recent study by Harvard shows that humans are actually gender fluid and most of our gender identity is indoctrinated into us through our family systems, society, and the media. \r\n\r\nThe fruit which comes from exploring male to male intimacy on an energetic and physical level is that all of our male armor/guarded defense systems vanish and we develop a greater level or capacity for intimacy with all people including women. \r\n\r\nThe structure of the workshop allows men to explore their relationships with their fathers, brothers and friends and then moves gently towards male to male affection, culminating in energetic play with sexual energy. This is not a clothing optional work shop, personal boundaries will be respected all of the time, and personal safety a priority! Participants will always be at choice and have a multitude of different opportunities with which to explore this theme.

Okay not really, but we pretend murder them at murder mystery parties.  So we thought, why not bring this kind of fun home with us?\r\n\r\nWe will host at three scheduled murders through-out the week, each being about an hour and a half event. Everyone gets a character to play and clues to help solve the murder. There is an emcee that keeps things moving along but this is performance art in its rawest form, everyone is a suspect (or the recently deceased) and it is up to the group to collaborate, negotiate shady agreements, blackmail or otherwise enjoy themselves.\r\n\r\nEach murder requires twenty people to play the roles for each murder we commit.  Each murder has a theme; a Circus, Santa's Workshop and an 80's Homecoming murder.  We encourage participants to come in costume and/or fully embrace their character.  We're snarky too so if people need a clue right there on the spot, a clue will be written for them and handed over in a small envelope.  A sample clue would be: \"Shave your goatee, with a knife, to get more pussy, in the lounge, you fucking hippie.\"  It's a silly good time and everyone gets drunk or hydrated, meets new people and whether they crack the case or not they win shit for best actor, best briber, best sleuth, best dressed.\r\n\r\nOn the days we're not committing foul play we will host a bar and a water hydration station (a giant igloo dispenser available throughout the entire day, filled with Earth20 from Bend, Oregon and chilled with a block of ice).","event_type":{"label":"Games"},"print_description":"Clue Bar 3:30- 5:30 pm\r\nTuesday Theme: Murder under the Big Top \r\nWednesday Theme:  Highschool Homecoming\r\nFriday Theme:  Santa's Workshop.","hosted_by_camp":"a1X0V000003HARsUAO","other_location":"Tokyo District","check_location":1,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/cluebar/","contact":"cluebarbrc@gmail.com","occurrence_set":[{"start_time":"2017-08-29T15:30:00-07:00","end_time":"2017-08-29T17:30:00-07:00"},{"start_time":"2017-08-30T15:30:00-07:00","end_time":"2017-08-30T17:30:00-07:00"},{"start_time":"2017-09-01T15:30:00-07:00","end_time":"2017-09-01T17:30:00-07:00"}]},{"title":"Second-Ever Last Annual Armageddon Alley Cat","uid":"23622","description":"Join our pedal-powered radical ritual!

The process works by subconsciously shifting your decision making over the next 10 years eventually making your vision a reality. You don't know what that day looks like? Don't worry, most people don't, but your subconscious already knows what is important to get there. The more amazing and compelling the vision that you let emerge, the more you will be drawn to it. How? Most people make between 80 to 400 decisions a day. A rich, compelling visualization with a lot of sensory \"hooks\" can shift those decisions towards your perfect future because the right choices will feel \"good.” We will start with a mindfulness of breath meditation, a gratitude exercise and then wake up the morning of your perfect day and explore it through a guided process. After, we will ask a few of those interested to share their visualization with the group. We look forward to sharing your future day together. Dr. Feelgood.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 45 Minute Meditation Session is 2PM M-F and followed up with creative cocktails, step up and have a feel good drink at our Camp Feel Good Compliment Bar/Sherpa Foot washing station!\r\n\r\nFor those in need of a deep dive in what you want out of life, we offer an Advice Booth Open every day!","event_type":{"label":"Class/Workshop"},"print_description":"Dr. Feelgood will help you picture your perfect day 10 years in your future.","hosted_by_camp":"a1Xd0000002riBREAY","check_location":1,"url":"","occurrence_set":[{"start_time":"2017-08-28T14:00:00-07:00","end_time":"2017-08-28T14:45:00-07:00"},{"start_time":"2017-08-29T14:00:00-07:00","end_time":"2017-08-29T14:45:00-07:00"},{"start_time":"2017-08-30T14:00:00-07:00","end_time":"2017-08-30T14:45:00-07:00"},{"start_time":"2017-08-31T14:00:00-07:00","end_time":"2017-08-31T14:45:00-07:00"},{"start_time":"2017-09-01T14:00:00-07:00","end_time":"2017-09-01T14:45:00-07:00"}]},{"title":"Boutique Opening Day - Dress A Virgin!","uid":"24099","description":"Veterans and Virgins, get playa ready with fun and funky fashions.

It is difficult to identify the genre of this theatre's stagings (as the word \"genre\" in itself implies some kind of traditionalism) and perhaps the company's style is closest to modern choreography in its most nonconformist form. The shows tell no story, reveal no plot, have no dimensions, or narrative. Rather, they mirror reality through dreams, bordering on that thin line between the outer and the inner worlds that interacts with the spectator through their own intuition or unconsciousness. As in the 'absolute mirror', every single person should see in each their work, an inner world and their own particular destiny. \r\nblackSKYwhite has received important awards for innovation in theater at FringeFirst - the international performing arts festival in Edinburgh, Scotland and have headlined performances at Glastronbury Festival.

And evidence is stacking up that psychoactive plants have played a major role in the development of language, art, and culture – not just for human beings, but across the biosphere.  \r\n\r\nAnd as within, so without: the dragons on the edge of our maps are turning into Pokémon in AR gaming; our science fiction narratives of de-extincted dinosaurs are looking likelier each day with radical advances in genetic engineering.  \r\n\r\nThanks to the psychedelic (\"mind manifesting\") power of our Promethean technologies, our dreams and fears have never been so fast to manifest as they are now.  It is time for us to take a long, hard look at what might be, if ANYTHING is possible. \r\n\r\nWhat did the psychedelic revolution of the 1960s teach us about how to handle the immense and terrifying pace of change these days?  Tim Leary said PCs would be the next LSD – and, in fact, it was their visionary journeys that they thank for inspiration, almost all the masterminds of the computing revolution.  So maybe there is something to the notion that the insights from psychedelic psychotherapy and of indigenous plant medicine traditions are just what the doctor ordered to help navigate this age's waves of great accelerating transformations.  \r\n\r\nJoin paleontologist-futurist Michael Garfield on a whirlwind tour through an age \"indistinguishable from magic\" – and a lighthearted but deadly serious examination of the responsibility of bringing new life forms and minds into this world as parents in our psychedelic century.\r\n\r\nWatch Michael's lightning presentation of this talk at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia Innovation Lab:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfjnWkDwYrc\r\nView the slideshow for this talk:\r\nhttps://www.patreon.com/posts/tech-ethics-as-7956513.","event_type":{"label":"Class/Workshop"},"print_description":"Somewhere in the interference pattern between the Wood Wide Web, LSD brain scans, the God Helmet, & CRISPR lies the future of our species...","hosted_by_camp":null,"other_location":"Palanque Norte Tent at Camp Soft Landing","check_location":1,"url":"","occurrence_set":[{"start_time":"2017-08-31T13:00:00-07:00","end_time":"2017-08-31T14:00:00-07:00"}]},{"title":"Rational Ritual and Pragmatic Mysticism with Sarah","uid":"24161","description":"Join Sarah McManus on discussing robust and resilient systems to help us navigate the challenges that face humanity, in ways that steer between the rocky shoals of nihilistic meaninglessness and the treacherous whirlpools of self-delusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2016, Sarah McManus was hired to be a research director at an ayahuasca center in Peru... and then fired for being too rational. She has a BA in Ecology from New College of Florida, a school that explicitly values ecstatic wonder. She was in a PhD program for Integrative Conservation, but left after realizing that humanity’s socioecological crises won't be solved by data alone: we need better tools for looking at hard problems with self-compassion, and for communicating and coordinating to co-create solutions. She writes about these topics, as well as psychedelic integration, at pricklesandgoo.com. \r\n\r\n \r\nThese places where reason and spirituality come into conflict can provide fertile ground for cultivating new ways of understanding and relating. If we can turn towards the tensions that arise when our existing belief structures are not able to meet our needs, we can find opportunities to help those frameworks grow and expand.

Specific musical instruments played during the meditation allow participants to use sound as a therapeutic tool to disconnect from discursive thinking and delve into a transcendental state. The goal is to enable participants to disengage their undesirable habitual patterns and to empower positive cognitive change. Most of the instruments used in a Sound Meditation are overtone-emitting instruments such as gongs, Tibetan singing bowls, bells, metallic discs, etc. These instruments have been used in meditation and sound healing for centuries in many cultures and continue to be used.\r\nAlexandre has conducted ethnomusicology fieldwork for 18 years in over 40 countries.

Do those plans include lots and lots of aluminum cans? Want to unload all those empty cans on playa while also helping the kids of Gerlach? \r\n\r\nWell then come on down to Recycle Camp and SHOW US YOUR CANS! At Recycle Camp we will take all of your aluminum cans of your hands as part of our gift to the playa. We are located directly behind the Center Camp Café on 6:00 and are open every day 9am to 5pm. Please no drop offs: participate! When you get there, we will help you quickly separate your cans before riding THE CRUSHINATOR, our magical bicycle-powered can crushing apparatus that crushes your cans flat so we can store as many as possible before scrapping the aluminum off-site. All of the money we generate from aluminum recycling is donated directly to the Gerlach school system. Everybody wins!\r\n\r\nWe can only accept ALUMINUM cans. Please no glass, plastic, steel, or tin cans, so please keep all of your water bottles, tetrapaks, soup cans, and coconut waters separated. A good rule of thumb for figuring out if something is aluminum: if you can't crush it by hand, then we don't want it! Some stout beers like Guinness also have a plastic widget inside that cannot be recycled with the aluminum, please remove it beforehand or we can show you how. \r\n\r\nPROTIP from the Recyclenaut Aluminati: bring a MESH bag to collect all of your cans in. Plastic garbage bags don't allow your cans to dry out and create a foul, sticky sludge. If you store them in a mesh bag before bringing them over to Recycle Camp it helps make things a little less juicy for you when we they get sorted and crushed. Be smart, plan ahead, Recycle Camp wants YOU to come CRUSH it with us!!!","event_type":{"label":"Miscellaneous"},"print_description":"CRUSH IT w/the Recyclonauts at Recycle Camp.

This workshop is called “Clarity and Consent” because it is about clearly communicating desires and boundaries for consensual sexual activity.\r\n\r\nThe subtitle of this playshop is “Negotiating Sex on the Playa,” so some of the material is about how to get to a positive, consensual agreement. But a negotiation is also successful if it helps to avoid an unwanted outcome, so we also discuss how to convince someone to go away.

In a ritual that stretches back before the coming of humankind – and that also anticipates a future when humans no longer exist – the aes sidhe revel in the endless cycle of light and darkness. In a hint of what is to come, those who find themselves in the path of the sidhe court first smell and taste the dusty grit of death and rebirth. Then they hear a pounding beat that heralds the bursting of the court from the Otherworld. Bystanders soon see a dark figure with pulsing veins of red light, curling horns, and a silver face that reflects a person’s soul back at them, followed by cavorting figures who tap rhythms on a variety of drums. \r\n\r\nIn a twisted caricature of the Pied Piper leading children astray, some of the aes sidhe beat a march for the procession, while other figures dart amongst onlookers, drawing bystanders into the procession as the group strides toward ritual stations of drums and light. The court – and its newly found attendants – pound a rhythm as the sun sinks below the horizon towards the inevitable transition, and transformation, from light to dark. The dark sidhe and its new court howl in joy as the glowing orb disappears beyond the skyline, welcoming the blessed cool of night.\r\n \r\nThe aes sidhe are looking for you to join our procession. Every dusk we will travel from our home at the ¡Bang! Tower to esplanade as we greet the dark in an expression of drumming, primal howling, and whatever else you can think up. The Gloaming procession will draw Black Rock City’s citizens to our 32 stations of drum and light placed around Esplanade. Join us as a spirit of the dark in a drumming celebration of sundown. \r\n\r\nIf you want to join us, link up with our Facebook group [https://www.facebook.com/BANGtribe/], email us, or swing by the 30-foot tall ¡Bang! Tower at the Baconeers Camp at 4:15 and Dance.","event_type":{"label":"Ritual/Ceremony"},"print_description":"Meet the sidhe of the Otherworld every dusk on esplanade as they welcome the dark.

Quite often, ignorant westerners who were raised to purchase meaning on a shelf or through a TV set can trigger sensitivities within traditional or sacred cultures, while at the same time individuals that seek in earnest to experience authentic meaning by transcending that very same commercial culture are easily stereotyped as insensitive or as frauds. The word “shamanism,” for example, is taken for granted and thrown around casually in festival culture, and yet who can agree on what it truly means in our context or who it legitimately offends?\r\n\r\nWe’ll uncover the complex history of this term while exploring a vision for planetary culture that integrates the profane and materialistic west with the sacred magic of the indigenous and the archaic. The story of the west is surprisingly rich with culture heroes (including the Cacophony Society and Suicide Club groups that Burning Man emerged from) that point the way towards a rich and meaningful cultural future, despite the overwhelming totality of capitalism. In fact, in the development of a global psychedelic culture, the world market has actually paved the way for a diverse confluence of neo-tribal adaptation and integration much the same way as the Romans built the roads that ultimately spread Christianity. Authentic cultural appropriation is the way forward and superficial cultural appropriation is a natural evolutionary byproduct.","event_type":{"label":"Class/Workshop"},"print_description":"Mitch Mignano \r\nSham-anism: Cultural Appropriation & The Struggle for the Sacred within A World Market.","hosted_by_camp":"a1X0V000003HFNRUA4","other_location":"9:30 / G","url":"","occurrence_set":[{"start_time":"2017-08-29T20:30:00-07:00","end_time":"2017-08-29T21:30:00-07:00"}]},{"title":"Evil Wake/Congratulations Card","uid":"24784","description":"Know who's not here this year?

Originally conceived and founded by SKULL and lovingly cared for by MABELL, MUFF and a small group of planners and care takers, the rides quickly grew from the original 8 \"Mammas and Papas\" to current ride counts of 1300+ Ridazz.\r\n\r\nSkeptics may scoff at the irreverence of this alleged \"Party on Wheels.\" But the party atmosphere just might be what has made this simple bicycle ride so popular in a city like Los Angeles where people barely get their mail without hopping in a car. Some attribute the movement to the high assed gas prices, or the frustration of LA traffic. Still others simply write off the Midnight Ridazz as a bunch of bored art school students. It's all of these things and more! \r\n\r\nConsider: Riding a bicycle is a sensual alternative to the \"boy in the bubble\" car voyages that hide everything good that a city has to offer. It is an experience in sights, sounds, thrills, physical activity, and local economy that could never be replicated by a night out at (Sh)City Walk. Midnight Ridazz is about riding bicyles, hanging out, acting silly, being whimsical, speaking up, and having a good heart. Come out and enjoy a relaxed pace bicycle ride at the end of a week of computers, dispatchers, rude customers, corporate politics and all the other crap that comes with living in a world of sad clowns.

Be inspired to dance and meditate, release your inner animal and break through your walls. From the dark side of the moon to the heart of the sun, the tiniest atom to the great interstellar expanse, the pulse of life to the great beyond, let us leave behind our divisions.  The eclipse brings darkness, yet the light ever returns.  We will always shine on, my bright ambassadors!

I have often felt the call of the dance from Pink Floyd’s music, momentary spans from so many different songs that called out to be joined together in one great epic track.  What you will hear has been carefully selected, shaped and spliced together to create a seamless experience, from a meditative beginning, ever amplified with a gentle rise in intensity, until we reach a riotous celebration of life and energy at the peak.   Like life itself, we release completely, winding down to a great finality.  What is at the end of our journey?  Have we lived our lives as completely and fully as we ever desired, as we look back from that long road?  We can only answer these questions for ourselves.  I invite you to take this opportunity to reflect on these things, and be yourself, as completely and fully as possible.   Let us live in a world we call can share.  With Love, Blue Jay.","event_type":{"label":"Gathering/Party"},"print_description":"Be inspired to dance and meditate through the gates of dawn to the endless river, from the dark side of the moon to the heart of the sun.","hosted_by_camp":"a1X0V000002rkuMUAQ","other_location":"2:15 & G","check_location":1,"url":"","contact":"jeeberjeeber@gmail.com","occurrence_set":[{"start_time":"2017-08-30T09:00:00-07:00","end_time":"2017-08-30T10:30:00-07:00"}]},{"title":"Heart of Kambo","uid":"25010","description":"Kambo is a powerful shamanic cleanse of Giant Monkey Tree Frog secretions applied by small burns.

However, sharing unbroken eye contact may increase your mindfulness and deepen your connections with people. Like meditation, eye gazing may leave you feeling more spiritually open, connected and relaxed. The difference with eye gazing is that you share these experiences with another person. People who have eye gazed have made long life connections, and even found love! Will you find love looking into the eyes of a stranger? Although we cannot guarantee this, but we can however facilitate a place for those willing to share an unbroken gaze into the eyes of a stranger. The space will be available for 30 minutes. Gazing partners will be limited to the number of consenting gazers in the space. Importantly there is not a time limit you can gaze for as long as or a little as you feel comfortable. We will not force gazing time and if any gazer decides to end a gaze we respect their decision. To get started we suggest you try eye gazing with someone you know for a minute. If you are not immediately ready to dive into a gaze feel free to watch other eye gazers. You may find mediating a few minutes before a gaze may ease you into it.","event_type":{"label":"Class/Workshop"},"print_description":"Eye Gazing.","hosted_by_camp":"a1X0V000002rkD3UAI","other_location":"3:30 & D","url":"","occurrence_set":[{"start_time":"2017-08-31T11:45:00-07:00","end_time":"2017-08-31T12:45:00-07:00"}]},{"title":"Lip Sync Battle","uid":"25172","description":"Come lip sync battle to your favorite song and artist of all time.

This transcendental breathwork guides you to awaken, to remember, to transform.  \r\n\r\nBy breathing in a conscious, connected, circular manner, you are actively breathing  life force energy into your Being; and, in doing so, you are inviting the intelligence that lives within the breath to dissolve, melt, release any blockages,  suppressed and/ or repressed emotions and experiences from our past.  In releasing the old, the stagnant, the unconscious patterning using your breath as your healing modality, you also then are open to receiving the “new” — new information, clarity, confirmation, creative expansion, and a whole host of possibilities based on your soul’s desires.\r\n\r\nWhile some people use plant medicines to access these non-ordinary states of consciousness, we will only be using our breath in our session — nothing will be ingested other than deeply connecting with our breath.  It is important that you are not under the influence of any substances during our time together.\r\nPlease bring an eye mask or bandana, yoga mat (or something to lie on), blanket(s) and a pillow.
