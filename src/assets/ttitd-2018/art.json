    "description": "SYMMETRA is an artificial organism with the ability to express her emotions. Since birth, SYMMETRA has suffered from agoraphobia and thusly developed a strongly misanthropic personality. Her main mode of expression is her body language, through which she communicates her emotional states. If left alone SYMMETRA creates slow, harmonic movement patterns on the surface of her skin. But if anyone gets close to her, she becomes more and more frightened and reduces her movement drastically. If someone gets even closer, SYMMETRA panics and starts to convulse heavily until given back the space she needs to be comfortable.",

    "description": "Fenghaizhen's design is inspired by the armor of Genghis Khan whose Mongolian empire ruled China during a part of the 14th century. The Mongolian army resisted their enemies' aggression thanks to Genghis Khan's military tactics, a strong system of weapons and their special armor. It had a very primitive but effective shock absorbing and impact diverting system. This art piece enlarges the armor to a height of 15 metres weighing 10 tons and embedded the soul of a Mongolian warrior. It wants to remind everyone, that we must never use artificial intelligence for war. Otherwise, humanity creates weapons that kill us. We hope that this warrior makes us realise that we shouldn't only worship technology, but also put restrictions in place.",

This pocket of altered acoustics contrasts strongly with the vast openness of the playa, transporting Participants to a sonic environment that is at once familiar and new. Spoken words, hand claps, performances on musical instruments, and all other sounds made within the installation are rewarded with a lush, surround-sound response as they are echoed throughout the space by a number of small pillars rising above the playa's surface, scattered across an area approximately 60 feet in diameter.",

Steps on all four sides invite Burners to access the interior and sit in a well under the lantern, their bodies scattered with multiple patterns of light.  The patterns originate in traditional and ancient Chinese fretwork but are manipulated with digital tools to create a contemporary interpretation.  The Lantern is an intricate structure that is as beautiful lit only by the sun in the daytime as it is when filled with man-made light at night. In China lanterns can also symbolize letting go of past selves and gaining a new self, a concept Burners can contemplate as they nestle in the heart of the structure.",

The structure is a place to reflect on the decisions we've made or choices we will have to make. The man is sculpted as a physically strong figure to remind people that making a choice takes strength and courage and should not be taken lightly. In the day time, the viewer can come take refuge in the space and look at the sculpture in the severe desert light to see the starkness of a situation. At night, they can return and see the space lit up with the dancing lights of possibilities, showing that with strength comes beauty, kindness, and the possibility of a better world.",

In the day look for a large ethereal pyramid, resonating light in a metamorphosis of perception to its visitors. You will discover that at night The Hologon will become an holographic beacon creating a distorted and enhanced illusion of light and space. The geometric structure will remain the same, but the visual illusions will take many forms and interactive formats. The Hologon name itself suggests a secret society of visual dreamers, members of which are self-initiated by interaction in the pyramid.",

Using a subversive formula of colliding seemingly innocent images with meaningful messages, my subtle alterations to known designs irrevocably disrupt their meaning. For instance, in my iconic Vandal Gummy series, I place the beloved sugary treat against a prison mugshot background, gripping an identity placard in between his gelatin paws. This juxtaposition between the nostalgic and the sinister has become a hallmark for my body of work. I cleverly and strategically encourage my viewers to examine their own critique of problematic institutions. It will look like a Giant 14' incarcerated Gummy Bear :)",

The OJOs' placement in deep playa evokes the isolation of being on the fringes of society.

The shadows act on the performer, a skater moving at various tempos relative to glide and stillness upon a synthetic (plastic) ice surface, by visually impacting movements, focus, and awareness of environmental interactions as light plays between umbra, penumbra, and illuminant upon the canvas. Projections will cast shadows in a kaleidoscopic ring around the performer or objects in the highlighted space. In this way the plastic surface and playa will be transformed into a canvas upon which light paints shadows interacting with one another and the performer.",

A perfect dodecahedron, each side depicting the iconography of one of the Twelve Olympians, centered in a stained-glass rosary design, this four-foot hanging lantern is lit from inside with 2,200 morphing LEDs, the colors and patterns constantly changing, never repeating.\r\n\r\nJust as mathematics are universal and unchanging, the intricate designs on each face will remain the same, and much like the higher vibrations of life, the LEDs under the surface will be constantly changing and flowing, making each moment under Stoicheia [ELEMENTS] totally unique. Digital stained-glass, Stoicheia [ELEMENTS] combines classic antiquity with the state-of-the-art technology through the common thread of geometry. In the reflections of each of the deities, we find reflections of ourselves.",

To raise our proverbial glass in celebration to all they did to create this wonderful, joyful life we have as part of Burning Man. While we feel their losses keenly, mourn their parting from this physical life, we know that they, and Larry in particular, liked to revel in the moment, seize the day, and share laughter and fun whenever and wherever possible. Even in the darkest moments, the darkest times, we need to cling to this remembrance of joy and laughter. This sculpture is a reminder, a touchstone, and a celebration.",

Its debut was at Kentuckian Pride Festival and participants were asked to \"Share their fear and leave it here.\" The closet is filled with monochromatic items that evoke a history of past and current issues that affect the LGBT community. This installation is part homage to Burning Man to show what experiences we can take from the playa and use to heal our communities. It is also a time capsule of what the LGBT community has gone through and what it has been through as we figure out how to heal and move forward through the world.",

Glitch represents us and the chain represents our connection and dependence on the concept of diamonds as a symbol of love. \n\nBoth diamonds are lined with LEDs. The larger diamond will sparkle, display beautiful light patterns, and will be responsive to the participants voice. The smaller diamond, Glitch, will have LED lights programmed to glitch out like a dying lightbulb, as if it is being weakened by being shackled to the larger diamond.",

I will ask people to share their story, or something important to them to inspire the portrait.  I would bring sculptures & my work to create an installation that focuses on acceptance and love. I would then invite people to hang out in the installation (it would be set up with places to chat), to talk to one another and to me. People that came to hang out in the installation would be offered the opportunity to get their story or portrait painted. They would be able to bring this painting home with them. I am also a 200 hr RYT yoga teacher and would love to incorporate yoga sessions.",

Flowers will be moving with the wind and some will be taking on alien faces and some will be robotic. All materials will be as green as possible to burn clean at the Temple. Flowers will be light in weight and easy to transport and install and then carried to the Temple to burn. The flowers are on a long cardboard tube placed over a well secured fence post and wired at the bottom. Lit at night with solar lights placed at the bottom and in the flowers themselves. A very nice place to meet people. Flowers are the mask of nature and will be burned to expose the face of God.",

The sign itself is made out of reclaimed sheet metal & discarded letters from dismantled corporate signs, hand painted, lit by 300 10-watt incandescent bulbs & securely attached to a welded base with wheels, the piece is fully mobile across the playa. You can usually find the BORING sign accompanying burns, alongside popular art projects, & framing the silhouette of the Man at sunset. With speakers and a playlist of danceables from the 60s, 70s and 80s, the mobile, rolling sign often attracts an entourage of sunset or late night boogie revelers.",

Looking back to the extravagance of Baroque Rome and medieval England; we sought out architecture and iconography that we could deconstruct and reconfigure for the modern age.  Our piece will be an open and interactive space for reflection, meditation and social engagement during Burning Man. It is the meeting of science fiction and spirituality, combined with the intrinsic mysticism of machines that sparks our interest.",

The objective of this piece, tied to the 2018 theme, \"I Robot,\" is to remind the citizens of Black Rock City (and the world) that despite the rush and frightening evolution of technology, we humans are still absolutely, positively, completely mortal -- and for all the unknowns in the world, we might as well enjoy our lives while we're still here.   \r\n\r\nSo many Burners come to BRC each year in search of a new way of living and a radical shift in perspective. Remembering that we are going to die is a profound and universally-accessible key to appreciating the here and now. \r\n\r\nStudies show that when people are exposed to concepts of their mortality, we perform tasks better, are more creative, and value collectivism more, and value the present more.\r\n\r\nOur mortality is, unexpectedly, a source of joy, of motivation to live, and an inspiration to play. We have only now. \r\n\r\nYou might die tomorrow. So live today.",

Some things may be as reliable as the sun rising, but where would we be when they stopped? As humans and as artists, we thrive to answer the question of how we react when the impossible occurs.

    "description": "\"Succubus\" is a digital collage/painting created by David Normal as part of the \"Pulp and Circumstance\" series of digital collages made in the Fall of 2017.  The image is derived from combining a \"Breck Girl\" ad from the 1950s with a Japanese Robot pulp from the '70s, with some classic sci-fi illustration depicting a monster from an HP Lovecraft story.  These combine to create a femme fatale possessed by a vampiric machine, a \"Succubus\".",

They will be stacked into a 6-7 foot tall piece, held together by a metal pole, with little sun at the base and dad at the top. Participants will be able to change the positioning of arms and legs, and play with each robot's additional bits (i.e. wooden around bead maze or tic-tac-toe board).",

    "description": "The group's 'Sailing the Dead Seas: Rockin' the Boats' installation is anchored in our childhood; you see a flotilla of oversized, whimsical, origami-like colorful 'paper boats,' each floating upon its 'waves+rippling waters.' Each boat is actually a teeter totter, ready to be rocked by the participants. Each craft has environmental sensors installed, you'll hear musical tones, as 'played' by the wind+motion of the boats. The effect is bio-elemental, aural soothing of our minds. They'll find the interior of the boats gilded in silver and gold, filled w/ inspirational quotes to complete the experience. Ships have materials to write 'notes of hope' and means of containing these utterances by attendees to be discovered and enjoyed by others.",

This pod will be an all metal walking machine with a steam punk appearance, lots of rust and plenty of moving gears. An operator will ride inside this machine during its performances on the playa but it will be designed to operate robotically as well.",

The embedded digital device let people write a message and get a paper printed encrypted version of it. This text can be decrypted later, after the burn, thanks to an online website.\nThis encourages more profound thoughts to be shared: secrets, mysteries, personal views, hard truths, post-burn advice, embarrassing compliments, declarations of love, or whatever suits them to be read later after the dust has settled.\nIt is meant to deepen a relationship, or to give a moment of bliss to a complete stranger that shall not be met again, or just for the joy of giving.\nThis structure also becomes a whole treasure hunt game: all the stashes and hideouts hide a secret journey that will let you become the master of the Key while unraveling mysteries and surprises about it. Explorers will need curiosity and obstinacy to solve the puzzles and riddles, unlock the stashes, decrypt the hidden messages\u2026 But those who complete the journey will discover new powers.\nFinally, it is a complete character that emerges: this structure appears to be a whole figure with its own history, emotions, states of mind, weaknesses. It is sometimes playing tricks on you, and slowly unraveling its depth to curious and persevering explorers.\nOne tip? Come back again, you might find the Key to be in another mood!",

Her roots correlate with all of the deepest parts of ourselves--the buried parts, which make us who we are. Exposing the roots and making them a part of the blossom at the top represents the idea that everything is an integral part of the whole self, even (and especially) the buried parts--not just the pretty flowery surface parts.",

There are several types of foliage within the garden: vines twist their way up the birdcage, while large flowers stand independent from the cage.\r\n\r\nThe focal point of the piece is the birdcage lying on its side,approximately 10' tall and about 20' long. The unlatched door of the birdcage lies open, and a swing invites participants to step inside. Over time, flowering vines have crept up the back and wrapped around the birdcage.\r\n\r\nSet away from the cage are large flowers adorned with fire elements and lighting. The flowers create a natural perimeter. At night, the ambient light and warmth emitted by the large flowers will draw people in.",

If given a zip code it will query the live weather conditions of the area in question and use the data to compose and perform a brief, wholly unique musical composition.\n\nCirrus is meant to question the nature of inspiration and artistic creation. Using a natural dataset, Cirrus operates within a learned musical framework. This method of creating is meant to mirror our own artistic process and growth.",

Appearing broken and hanging inexplicably in place, the mind-altering assembly of stone challenges our perception of what we think we know, thought we understood. The sculpture is fundamentally an open symbol. The break in the form demands attention, presenting the shifting dualities of continuity and rupture, menace and security, unbidden fear and unearned trust. It is both heavy and light, impossible, yet it stands, challenging our perceptions.   Timeless and transient, the stone arch stands in contrast to our disposable culture.",

The sculpture clearly highlights characteristics of a human form; muscle, sinuous tendon, sculpted hands, feet. Yet, it's a composite of mechanical debris and steel. Viewers may hypothesize, is this a man? is it part robot? and what is the blurry fine-line between each? The other huge component is the presence of the wheat. It symbolizes abundance, life, fertility. It is food, subsistence, of which without, the human race would be extinct. Viewers can look closer at the inherent  beauty of the human form, contemplate mechanics/technology or most importantly, be reminded of our absolute reliance on nature in the end.",

    "description": "A series of clouds is generated and gently held in place by a machine-like sculpture. From twilight to sunrise, the clouds are illuminated by an interactive network of LED lights, which reveal their inner geometries. The clouds appear, float over the playa, and then dissolve into thin air. This process of delocalization of the cloud to the desert environment evokes a surreal experience.\nThe installation forms a juxtaposition of a fabricated structure and a natural phenomenon. This supposed contrast between human technology and nature will be explored as a space of unseen possibilities for symbiosis and sustainability.",

Known for her spirited illuminated truisms, Conceptual light artist Olivia Steele returns to the playa with a question. \r\nAs we embark into the wild unknown of artificial intelligence and robotics, one must acknowledge the endless potential and the potentially catastrophic. A crucial aspect to our evolution as a human race is replacing fear of the unknown with curiosity. This year, she invites you to Stop looking for answers and Live the question.  Art is metaphor, and so is this installation. Let it serve as an invitation to the imagination, in the form of a glowing query asking: \"What If This Is All Real?\"\r\n\r\nIF YOU WERE WAITING FOR A SIGN THIS IS IT.",

Seeing the icon of lady liberty illustrated in this manner startles the viewers into taking notice. It asks viewers to think about gun issues from an emotional and compassionate perspective rather than the standard partisan talking points we often hear in the media. It puts a serious topic into a unique perspective for Participants, stirring emotions, and invoking deeper thoughts, questioning the meaning and purpose of the Second Amendment and what it means to be free.",

The reward:  embroidered iron-on patches will be loaded into all the mousetraps hanging from the innermost ring.  Over the course of the week, we are planning to distribute 10,000 patches through the art piece.  The risk:  all of the remaining mousetraps that hang from the other rings might be set and could be triggered as one pursues a reward.  Not to worry, all of the \"risk\" mousetraps have had their springs modified to reduce the power so the traps only have a bark and no bite.",

    "description": "Dust to Glass is a first hand experience of the glazing and firing process of ceramic art. The installation is a portable low fire envelope kiln that rests on a steel frame. Within the kiln the magic happens at temperatures over 1600\u00b0F. As flames shoot out of the chimney the kiln roars full of pendents and tiles decorated with various glazes and playa dust which turn to glass and solidify. The raging inferno ends with a moment of silence before the faint crackling sound fills the kiln as the glazes crackle and craze from the sudden temperature drop. When the kiln opens a red hot glow begins to grow as the top rolls down the elongated frame. Slowly the glow dims and reveals the beautiful colors and textures of all the ceramic pieces that were just hand decorated shortly before. The process of firing ceramics is an ancient tradition that dates back as far as the first known civilizations of human kind, and this installation allows the participant to connect with their most ancient roots.",

Traditionally, the snake was viewed as an ambiguous symbol expressing the dual nature of the work of the physician: life vs death, health vs sickness. Today, this can be applied to many areas in medicine. For example, advances in science and technology can prolong life significantly but at the cost of quality. Three areas will be addressed: the patient, the provider, and the struggle of both of these to retain their humanity as they interact in the world of medicine. Each of these components has its own set of conundrums, ironies, and hypocrisies. These will be represented on prayer flags and will be illuminated by a different color light.",

The Trike is a piece of wreckage that sat prominently atop a burned out Playa-bound vehicle. A handful of courageous Burners apparently walked the last 20 miles of their Journey on FOOT. All their shit, except what they could carry, literally BLEW Up in that Fire. The Forks of the Trike were Fused to the Roof of the VW Squareback (we think?). It was pulling an Airstream that melted to the ground. Bella picked up as much wreckage as we could find at 1AM. We proclaimed the Trike ART, Honored it, installed it at Airport 2017. Eventually, Everyone and Everything Finds its way Home. The Playa Provides, and the Playa Gives to New Possibilities even in Desparity",

A single blade snaps under pressure, a collective of blades spreads the load and thrives.\r\nThe oasis created by Playa Grass Ballet is a gathering point for shade in the daytime, for conversation and light based visual meditation at night.

    "description": "Sky Mandala is a social art making concept of interactive and participatory sculpture. It is a place to congregate expressively and playfully under, to wonder at the sky though, and for making friends around. Sky Mandala is a \"social-sculpture\" i.e. a community generating venue to be located in the (9&B plaza?). The weaving of mandalas is a metaphor that realizes that which it symbolizes: the making of new friendships through collaborative art-making, which weaves a web of creatively empowered community. The artifact that the participants create is a molecular looking framework of wood, string mandalas, and at night, lighting. This artifact will offer a venue of expression and gather for neighborhood culture throughout the week. The camps in the neighborhood will network to offer open-invitation happenings and performances using this sculpture as a venue. The sculpture will grow as our neighborhood community grows through mandala making and erecting workshops that will allow the larger community to help expand the initial sculpture -- for many it will be their first chance at doing hands-on burning man sculptural art! \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s meaning and intended result is the web of relationships that arise from participation, networking, openness, inclusion, bonding, and commitment to community and to celebratory art culture. If you would like to donate or participate on the build team, please email us. If you have an idea for fantastic performance art, fine oration, mind-bending experience, silly social game, or absurd etc. for the center of the plaza please reach out and we will connect you with the neighborhood planning conversation being facilitated by placement and the art department.",

If they don't like how you're playing or if you separate them from the flock, they will object, using their harshest voices and most glaring flashing lights. iSheep are trans-species: They were once humans acting like sheep, but now they're iSheep, awake and wise.",

    "description": "Camera Lucida is a camera-like sculpture that enables twilight and night photos of people using warm light from a fire \"flash\". Subjects stand in front and the Burner taking the photo walks inside to trigger a countdown. Using any camera, including smartphones, aimed through the lens-like portal, or optionally the built-in camera, the explosion of light adds theatricality to playa portraiture and lasts long enough for manual coordination of the camera trigger to suffice. Named after an 1800s invention used to project objects onto paper for drawing and a 1980 book about photography by philosopher Roland Barthes, who uses the term \"punctum\" to describe \"that rare detail that makes the viewer feel something and pushes the photo even further.\"",

    "description": "Wrong Desert's plants have mysteriously migrated to the Black Rock Desert, a place far different from their origins. This solar powered cactus garden uses only its immediate resources to live. It's a sustainable oasis deep in the electronic desert where weird plants and animals thrive.\r\n\r\nUsing only sunlight and the occasional rain, cacti evolved to use no more than what they need.  This spoke to me as a powerful potential direction I hope Burning Man can take, to become a more sustainable event and for its participants better citizens of the planet. We can evolve past using diesel, gasoline, and propane to create Black Rock City each year.  We can create life-changing art and experiences and also be good stewards of the environment.",

It's perched on the back of that most emblematic icon of western expansion, a pickup truck. One with legs, claws, eyeballs and antennae made out of rusty farm equipment. \r\n\r\nA 1978 F-150 masquerading as a rusty crustacean wearing a giant bison skull on it's back the way a hermit crab inhabits the shell of another sea creature. \r\n\r\nThe top of the skull is cut off and suspended between the horns. Occupying the space below and looking up, one is confronted by the smooth convulations of the underside of the skull plate that corresponds to the shape of the brain that used to live there. Makes you think...maybe the about the bison and the people.",
