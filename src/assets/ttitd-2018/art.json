    "description": "SYMMETRA is an artificial organism with the ability to express her emotions. Since birth, SYMMETRA has suffered from agoraphobia and thusly developed a strongly misanthropic personality. Her main mode of expression is her body language, through which she communicates her emotional states. If left alone SYMMETRA creates slow, harmonic movement patterns on the surface of her skin. But if anyone gets close to her, she becomes more and more frightened and reduces her movement drastically. If someone gets even closer, SYMMETRA panics and starts to convulse heavily until given back the space she needs to be comfortable.",

When Particiants use their cellphones to text snark back at Burning Manhole, the communication technology of todays Burners is included.",

    "description": "Fenghaizhen's design is inspired by the armor of Genghis Khan whose Mongolian empire ruled China during a part of the 14th century. The Mongolian army resisted their enemies' aggression thanks to Genghis Khan's military tactics, a strong system of weapons and their special armor. It had a very primitive but effective shock absorbing and impact diverting system. This art piece enlarges the armor to a height of 15 metres weighing 10 tons and embedded the soul of a Mongolian warrior. It wants to remind everyone, that we must never use artificial intelligence for war. Otherwise, humanity creates weapons that kill us. We hope that this warrior makes us realise that we shouldn't only worship technology, but also put restrictions in place.",

Spoken words, hand claps, performances on musical instruments, and all other sounds made within the installation are rewarded with a lush, surround-sound response as they are echoed throughout the space by a number of small pillars rising above the playa's surface, scattered across an area approximately 60 feet in diameter.",

Steps on all four sides invite Burners to access the interior and sit in a well under the lantern, their bodies scattered with multiple patterns of light.  The patterns originate in traditional and ancient Chinese fretwork but are manipulated with digital tools to create a contemporary interpretation.  The Lantern is an intricate structure that is as beautiful lit only by the sun in the daytime as it is when filled with man-made light at night. In China lanterns can also symbolize letting go of past selves and gaining a new self, a concept Burners can contemplate as they nestle in the heart of the structure.",

    "description": "Divine Feminine Warrior Goddess (DFWG) Portal Pyramid was designed to represent 4 facets of a woman's essence.  DFWG consists of forms of 4 female torsos.  Each is decorated uniquely to their theme, with \"jewels\" and lights to represent the Artist's vision of Divine, Feminine, Warrior & Goddess. The torsos act as \"sentries\" to the Sacred Geometry of the Portal Pyramid, which contains a meditation bench. It asks the Participant to enter, reflect & ask \"What makes me Divine? Feminine? Warrior? Goddess? Ultimately empowering the viewer to recognize and embrace the many facets of the unique & powerful jewel that they are. The archway is designed to align with the Pyramid, the Temple/Man and sunrise to the East.",

This includes; but is not limited to, clearer vision, greater perspective and perception, an increased ability for imagination, intuition, clairvoyance, discernment, and all that allows for greater awareness and vision.  It is the intention of the I-Portal to \"wake the fuck up\" all those who enter.",

The man is sculpted as a physically strong figure to remind people that making a choice takes strength and courage and should not be taken lightly. In the day time, the viewer can come take refuge in the space and look at the sculpture in the severe desert light to see the starkness of a situation. At night, they can return and see the space lit up with the dancing lights of possibilities, showing that with strength comes beauty, kindness, and the possibility of a better world.",

    "description": "I have since gone on to generate more and more content that sparks thoughtful dialogue and nuanced socio-awareness. Using a subversive formula of colliding seemingly innocent images with meaningful messages, my subtle alterations to known designs irrevocably disrupt their meaning. For instance, in my iconic Vandal Gummy series, I place the beloved sugary treat against a prison mugshot background, gripping an identity placard in between his gelatin paws. This juxtaposition between the nostalgic and the sinister has become a hallmark for my body of work. I cleverly and strategically encourage my viewers to examine their own critique of problematic institutions. It will look like a Giant 14' incarcerated Gummy Bear :)",

Much of our current environmental predicament stems from attachment – attachment to a way of doing things, attachment to material things and a consumerist lifestyle, even an attachment to our own identities.\r\n\r\nThe Coloring Book to Grow a New Future is a coloring book based on this principle of impermanence and transformation. Interwoven with organic parsley, dill, and basil seeds, the paper upon which the reader colors is meant to be torn up and buried in the ground, literally to grow a new future. A lot of what we hear about climate change is doom and gloom. It's important to understand what is at stake and where we stand, but it's important to plant hope.",

    "description": "The Flight Attendant (TFA) is an interactive harm-reduction tool and research project. In the guise of a vintage suitcase, TFA is a fun way for participants to learn the relative safety of drug combinations while anonymously sharing usage data to further harm reduction research.\r\n\r\nTFA visualizes data from TripSit's Guide to Drug Combinations, an open-source chart indicating the relative safety of the combination of 25 different psychoactive substances, from alcohol to antidepressants to designer psychedelics. While you may be familiar with the effects of two drugs on their own, combining them can have unexpected synergistic—or deadly—effects. Knowing the difference is critical for safe and enjoyable experiences.",

The shadows act on the performer, a skater moving at various tempos relative to glide and stillness upon a synthetic (plastic) ice surface, by visually impacting movements, focus, and awareness of environmental interactions as light plays between umbra, penumbra, and illuminant upon the canvas. Projections will cast shadows in a kaleidoscopic ring around the performer or objects in the highlighted space. In this way the plastic surface and playa will be transformed into a canvas upon which light paints shadows interacting with one another and the performer.",

    "description": "Opening The Closet is a look at LGBT issues faced today. It is an 8 foot tall by 25 feet wide closet insert that looks at fears and issues faced by the community today. Its debut was at Kentuckian Pride Festival and participants were asked to \"Share their fear and leave it here.\" The closet is filled with monochromatic items that evoke a history of past and current issues that affect the LGBT community. This installation is part homage to Burning Man to show what experiences we can take from the playa and use to heal our communities. It is also a time capsule of what the LGBT community has gone through and what it has been through as we figure out how to heal and move forward through the world.",

The obelisk, made up of aluminum sheets with hundreds of holes poked into them, will shine in the playa sun and emit strange lights through the holes at night. Throughout human history, obelisks, with their upwardly-tapered walls, have been used to either symbolize or direct attention to the sun (Earth's source of light). Thus, Photoasis (named after the particles which make up light, photons) simply pays its respects to and represents the light that begins each day.",

Inside it is an intricate composition of clear triangular patterns. The structural geometry is echoed on each face combining to form one harmonious singularity.\n\nParticipants interact with the structure from the moment they enter Lûz as their re ections are incorporated into the acrylic and then refracted amongst the members.\nLûz distorts those refections further by changing the light spectrum revealing new geometric landscapes. This makes the viewer part of a dynamic experience, taking them on a journey  owing seamlessly from one composition into the next.",

The art installation features two larger than life geometric diamonds, one third the size of the other. The smaller diamond, named glitch, is shackled with a large chain to the larger diamond. Glitch represents us and the chain represents our connection and dependence on the concept of diamonds as a symbol of love. \n\nBoth diamonds are lined with LEDs. The larger diamond will sparkle, display beautiful light patterns, and will be responsive to the participants voice. The smaller diamond, Glitch, will have LED lights programmed to glitch out like a dying lightbulb, as if it is being weakened by being shackled to the larger diamond.",

I will ask people to share their story, or something important to them to inspire the portrait.  I would bring sculptures & my work to create an installation that focuses on acceptance and love. I would then invite people to hang out in the installation (it would be set up with places to chat), to talk to one another and to me. People that came to hang out in the installation would be offered the opportunity to get their story or portrait painted. They would be able to bring this painting home with them.

Artificial intelligence in mass culture finally mutates in silent hearing with the potential of an unconditional enemy.\r\nThe installation \"Back to the Future\" brings us back to the golden age of sci-fi, suggesting a time when faith in the boundless and omnipotent human mind and spirit was boundless.

The sign itself is made out of reclaimed sheet metal & discarded letters from dismantled corporate signs, hand painted, lit by 300 10-watt incandescent bulbs & securely attached to a welded base with wheels, the piece is fully mobile across the playa. You can usually find the BORING sign accompanying burns, alongside popular art projects, & framing the silhouette of the Man at sunset. With speakers and a playlist of danceables from the 60s, 70s and 80s, the mobile, rolling sign often attracts an entourage of sunset or late night boogie revelers.",

    "description": "Shasta is a kinetic light art sculpture that interacts with sunlight, wind and LED´s.  It is composed of hundreds of metal mirror squares that move with the wind while reflecting its surrounding space.  When looking at it, participants interact by seeing themselves reflected in its surface as if it was made out of water. Wind and water are revealed as being more similar than expected. This piece is about the relationship within us and natural elements.  It invites us to contemplate it from different angles and reflect about how we perceive the natural beauty of Nature.",

It all starts with the beans, which have to be ground to the proper consistency.  See and feel what that consistency is, and how the aroma makes the cup all the better.

Remembering that we are going to die is a profound and universally-accessible key to appreciating the here and now. \r\n\r\nStudies show that when people are exposed to concepts of their mortality, we perform tasks better, are more creative, and value collectivism more, and value the present more.\r\n\r\nOur mortality is, unexpectedly, a source of joy, of motivation to live, and an inspiration to play. We have only now. \r\n\r\nYou might die tomorrow. So live today.",

The rest of the robot body will be created from recycled farm equipment parts, gears, etc. The background of the robot panel will be covered in functioning gears. The gears, when turned by handle, will ring harmony bells. We believe robots shouldn't just be used or thought of as tools to make things in assembly lines. Robots should also be used in creative ways. If this robot was real, it could play music in different settings, like in cancer wards, or for music therapy in recovery wards.",

    "description": "Creu Hudol (Welsh for \"Magical Being\") was inspired by a potential for an elegant and beautiful future with technology. Creu Hudol is feminine in appearance calling upon a softer and and receptive feel. Her joints are made of glass to emulate the crystals used in technology today. Her open posture represents her willingness to serve others for the betterment of humanity. Her upright and proud stance representing her power. The glass crown represents a spiritual element, bringing in points of light to catch the eye. Her head is clear and made of glass representing an open and clear understanding (perhaps to be filled with new ideas). Creu Hudol stands upon a pedestal of glass panels to rise her up even higher into consciousness.",

Human touch and creativity are foundations of mechanical invention.   We confront the illusion of uniformity and sameness. Upon closer inspection, the interior and exterior materials of each robot are dynamic and invite tactile interactive play- some thermochromatic, some glow, some holographic, some transparent with suspended embedded symbols within, representing aspects of human nature—violence, generosity, greed, love.   The robots will invite us to touch them, witness visual change, and contemplate the complexities and limitations of technology.",

Each boat is actually a teeter totter, ready to be rocked by the participants. Each craft has environmental sensors installed, you'll hear musical tones, as 'played' by the wind+motion of the boats. The effect is bio-elemental, aural soothing of our minds. They'll find the interior of the boats gilded in silver and gold, filled w/ inspirational quotes to complete the experience. Ships have materials to write 'notes of hope' and means of containing these utterances by attendees to be discovered and enjoyed by others.",

Is it meant to be a fun and surprising beacon for open-ended interactions as well as a treasure hunt game.\nThe main purpose of this piece is to encourage private and deep, thoughtful communication between friends and strangers. The embedded digital device let people write a message and get a paper printed encrypted version of it. This text can be decrypted later, after the burn, thanks to an online website.\nThis encourages more profound thoughts to be shared: secrets, mysteries, personal views, hard truths, post-burn advice, embarrassing compliments, declarations of love, or whatever suits them to be read later after the dust has settled.\nIt is meant to deepen a relationship, or to give a moment of bliss to a complete stranger that shall not be met again, or just for the joy of giving.\nThis structure also becomes a whole treasure hunt game: all the stashes and hideouts hide a secret journey that will let you become the master of the Key while unraveling mysteries and surprises about it. Explorers will need curiosity and obstinacy to solve the puzzles and riddles, unlock the stashes, decrypt the hidden messages… But those who complete the journey will discover new powers.\nFinally, it is a complete character that emerges: this structure appears to be a whole figure with its own history, emotions, states of mind, weaknesses. It is sometimes playing tricks on you, and slowly unraveling its depth to curious and persevering explorers.\nOne tip? Come back again, you might find the Key to be in another mood!",

    "description": "TIM (Temporal Imaginary Machine) is a Megalophone. A Megalophone is a giant ridiculous instrument that looks better than it sounds, and thinks its more important than you. You might recognize TIM by his glowing eyes and gaping mouth. His head is the only part emerging from the ground. He is a trash conglomerate, made of scraps and tubes and computer parts. Wires are going in and out of his head, and at night you can see the pulsing lights of his synapses. If you approach TIM, take a mallet from his side and gently bang on his musical teeth. If you can squeeze inside his mouth without getting cut by his teeth, take a seat inside.",

Once at the “front door” to the shop, burners will be outfitted in leather aprons and gloves then introduced to their blacksmith for the night.  An international crew of highly skilled blacksmiths have been assembled to host this year’s shop.  Each burner will then have a chance to use traditional blacksmithing tools as well as the iconic anvil to forge this year’s limited edition steel form into the sculpture of their dreams.

People will be able to climb up the roots and \"get inside her head\" bouncing and rocking with the use of large suspension springs. Flo represents the notion of learning to flow with all of the parts of one's self, and finding strength within them. Her roots correlate with all of the deepest parts of ourselves--the buried parts, which make us who we are. Exposing the roots and making them a part of the blossom at the top represents the idea that everything is an integral part of the whole self, even (and especially) the buried parts--not just the pretty flowery surface parts.",

Over time, flowering vines have crept up the back and wrapped around the birdcage.\r\n\r\nSet away from the cage are large flowers adorned with fire elements and lighting.

Appearing broken and hanging inexplicably in place, the mind-altering assembly of stone challenges our perception of what we think we know, thought we understood. The sculpture is fundamentally an open symbol. The break in the form demands attention, presenting the shifting dualities of continuity and rupture, menace and security, unbidden fear and unearned trust. It is both heavy and light, impossible, yet it stands, challenging our perceptions.   Timeless and transient, the stone arch stands in contrast to our disposable culture.",

Viewers may hypothesize, is this a man? is it part robot? and what is the blurry fine-line between each? The other huge component is the presence of the wheat. It symbolizes abundance, life, fertility. It is food, subsistence, of which without, the human race would be extinct. Viewers can look closer at the inherent  beauty of the human form, contemplate mechanics/technology or most importantly, be reminded of our absolute reliance on nature in the end.",

Its Soul is a blockchain-based software governing its reproduction.\nWandering through the playa, you may stumble on the Plantoid Garden, in the middle of which are three giant 10 to 20 foot tall mechanical plants made of welded scrap metal, with a strong but elegant steampunk flavor. Their stems are made of large, industrial chain; their leaves are made of photovoltaic panels and their flowers of forged metal. Half plant, half-android, they come to life when triggered with sunlight, wind and human attention.",

From twilight to sunrise, the clouds are illuminated by an interactive network of LED lights, which reveal their inner geometries. The clouds appear, float over the playa, and then dissolve into thin air. This process of delocalization of the cloud to the desert environment evokes a surreal experience.\nThe installation forms a juxtaposition of a fabricated structure and a natural phenomenon. This supposed contrast between human technology and nature will be explored as a space of unseen possibilities for symbiosis and sustainability.",

    "description": "Robeo and Julietech is an interactive story book telling the tragic robot playa love story of Robeo Montigear and Julietech Capulazer. Comprised of three vertical dual sided panels with murals on a triangular base to tell its story, the viewer must stand on each side to view and spin the panel around, \"flipping the pages.\" The panels poke fun at the story of Romeo and Juliette, a story as old as time preaching the wrong kind of love.  It tells a story of death and a life unfulfilled because of the lack of another person. The presence of love be it romantic or not in our lives should heighten our potential to give back, to be our best selves. Life should not be about the love received, but the love we are lucky enough to send out everyday.",

Light, sound, vibration, scent and even taste are stimulated and synchronized to create a state of hyper-stimulation. Thereby, altering participants' perception, allowing them to dissociate from their sense of self, and become open to an alternate realm of human experience—LazyLand. No one can effectively describe what LazyLand is like. It must be experienced to be appreciated.",

Over the course of the week, we are planning to distribute 10,000 patches through the art piece.  The risk:  all of the remaining mousetraps that hang from the other rings might be set and could be triggered as one pursues a reward.  Not to worry, all of the \"risk\" mousetraps have had their springs modified to reduce the power so the traps only have a bark and no bite.",

    "description": "Dust to Glass is a first hand experience of the glazing and firing process of ceramic art. The installation is a portable low fire envelope kiln that rests on a steel frame. Within the kiln the magic happens at temperatures over 1600°F. As flames shoot out of the chimney the kiln roars full of pendents and tiles decorated with various glazes and playa dust which turn to glass and solidify. The raging inferno ends with a moment of silence before the faint crackling sound fills the kiln as the glazes crackle and craze from the sudden temperature drop. When the kiln opens a red hot glow begins to grow as the top rolls down the elongated frame. Slowly the glow dims and reveals the beautiful colors and textures of all the ceramic pieces that were just hand decorated shortly before. The process of firing ceramics is an ancient tradition that dates back as far as the first known civilizations of human kind, and this installation allows the participant to connect with their most ancient roots.",

This map will consider time and experiences as additional orienting tools. The images are both personal and universal and like memories you think you have neatly tucked away, they emerge and fade in the strangest ways. No one journey is better or more important than another. We need each other and our intersections along the way.",

Traditionally, the snake was viewed as an ambiguous symbol expressing the dual nature of the work of the physician: life vs death, health vs sickness. Today, this can be applied to many areas in medicine. For example, advances in science and technology can prolong life significantly but at the cost of quality. Three areas will be addressed: the patient, the provider, and the struggle of both of these to retain their humanity as they interact in the world of medicine. Each of these components has its own set of conundrums, ironies, and hypocrisies. These will be represented on prayer flags and will be illuminated by a different color light.",

Using stereo-cards viewed through a specially designed, multi-station, interactive viewer, the PtP brings the magic of Victorian entertainment to today's audience.  It is also a place to learn how to take your own 3d images and the PtP welcomes submissions for new images to add to the library.",

All contributors to the Museum are kept 100% anonymous for their safety and comfort, and we have Guardians on hand at all times to maintain the safety and respectful nature of the Museum.  This project is a gift to the community and to all the burners out there who suffer and struggle in silence.",

We are hoping our \"circle of friends\" will inspire the community circle of friends. Ultimately we plan to have fire effects and viewer participation! This year we are doing a single humanoid figure as a preview for our larger scale project in 2019.",

The Trike is a piece of wreckage that sat prominently atop a burned out Playa-bound vehicle. A handful of courageous Burners apparently walked the last 20 miles of their Journey on FOOT. All their shit, except what they could carry, literally BLEW Up in that Fire. The Forks of the Trike were Fused to the Roof of the VW Squareback (we think?). It was pulling an Airstream that melted to the ground. Bella picked up as much wreckage as we could find at 1AM. We proclaimed the Trike ART, Honored it, installed it at Airport 2017.

    "description": "Playa Grass Ballet is a macro-scaled tuft of abstracted grass fabricated of heavy gauge aluminum, LED electronics and granite. The blades move in the wind and just like \"real\" grass the blades lean on each other in community for collective strength. Humans may take note of this and learn how working together is more powerful than going it alone. A single blade snaps under pressure, a collective of blades spreads the load and thrives.\r\nThe oasis created by Playa Grass Ballet is a gathering point for shade in the daytime, for conversation and light based visual meditation at night. We hope those interacting with the sculpture will come closer together, converse, heal and visualize greater harmony through naturally designed co-reliance.",

It is a place to congregate expressively and playfully under, to wonder at the sky though, and for making friends around. Sky Mandala is a \"social-sculpture\" i.e. a community generating venue to be located in the (9&B plaza?). The weaving of mandalas is a metaphor that realizes that which it symbolizes: the making of new friendships through collaborative art-making, which weaves a web of creatively empowered community. The artifact that the participants create is a molecular looking framework of wood, string mandalas, and at night, lighting. This artifact will offer a venue of expression and gather for neighborhood culture throughout the week. The camps in the neighborhood will network to offer open-invitation happenings and performances using this sculpture as a venue. The sculpture will grow as our neighborhood community grows through mandala making and erecting workshops that will allow the larger community to help expand the initial sculpture -- for many it will be their first chance at doing hands-on burning man sculptural art! \r\n\r\nIt’s meaning and intended result is the web of relationships that arise from participation, networking, openness, inclusion, bonding, and commitment to community and to celebratory art culture. If you would like to donate or participate on the build team, please email us. If you have an idea for fantastic performance art, fine oration, mind-bending experience, silly social game, or absurd etc. for the center of the plaza please reach out and we will connect you with the neighborhood planning conversation being facilitated by placement and the art department.",

Adults can weigh as much as eight hundred pounds. The most significant and endearing aspect of these giant playa octopuses is their ability to communicate and emote with playa visitors.

Pet them or play gently--even play soft games of \"bumper sheep.\" But ask before doing something uncomfortable. If they don't like how you're playing or if you separate them from the flock, they will object, using their harshest voices and most glaring flashing lights. iSheep are trans-species: They were once humans acting like sheep, but now they're iSheep, awake and wise.",

Taking the \"Long View\" is crucial to survival. Combining content and joy, we ask the viewer to develop a relationship with the animal. Polar bears help humans imagine a faraway place, a place most will never visit.  They are uniquely positioned as ambassadors to bring the arctic into human awareness. Animals disappear to make room for our cars. Turning wrecked cars into monumental animals visually reverses this process and impacts the consciousness of the viewer.",

This art piece reflects on the way Black Rock City teases our perception of reality as we generate and explore it together, like a shared dream. It celebrates how individual journeys cross paths in the dust, yet altogether intertwine to shape an evanescent landscape and its broader community.",

The timber modules start large enough to hold small alcoves in which people can write in peace. As participants walk through the path, the timber modules lift up and become thinner and thinner towards the sky as people reach the central mandala.",

Participants hear and feel the meditator's heartbeat magnified into deep-bass, mixed with a lush soundscape sampled from nature, sacred tunes, anthropology archives, and Burners murmuring self-authored prayer.

Emotional engineering of robots lowers our barriers to privacy and clouds our perception of risk. BEBOT's forked devil's tail suggests that all may not be as innocent and harmless as it seems.",

    "description": "Wrong Desert's plants have mysteriously migrated to the Black Rock Desert, a place far different from their origins. This solar powered cactus garden uses only its immediate resources to live. It's a sustainable oasis deep in the electronic desert where weird plants and animals thrive.\r\n\r\nUsing only sunlight and the occasional rain, cacti evolved to use no more than what they need.  This spoke to me as a powerful potential direction I hope Burning Man can take, to become a more sustainable event and for its participants better citizens of the planet. We can evolve past using diesel, gasoline, and propane to create Black Rock City each year.  We can create life-changing art and experiences and also be good stewards of the environment.",

    "description": "There's a giant bleached headbone lying on the ground in the desert. A giant skull with horns. Bison horns.  It's perched on the back of that most emblematic icon of western expansion, a pickup truck. One with legs, claws, eyeballs and antennae made out of rusty farm equipment. \r\n\r\nA 1978 F-150 masquerading as a rusty crustacean wearing a giant bison skull on it's back the way a hermit crab inhabits the shell of another sea creature. \r\n\r\nThe top of the skull is cut off and suspended between the horns. Occupying the space below and looking up, one is confronted by the smooth convulations of the underside of the skull plate that corresponds to the shape of the brain that used to live there. Makes you think...maybe the about the bison and the people.",
