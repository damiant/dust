    "description": "More marvelous than a Marvel comic origin story, the Oracle of Gerlach was spawned when a dust storm overturned a bank of overused portapotties. Playa dust joined with magical effluent from thousands of Burners, and the Oracle arose and came to be. The Oracle is neither male nor female, but is the spirit of humanity.  He/she will once again rise from deep within the Playa to bring order to chaos, enlighten the masses, and provide questionable guidance for a creative and fulfilling life. The Oracle has brought her priests and ministers to serve and bestow her divine enlightenment through the use of magic Oracle cards, secret wisdom, and fantastic readings.",

We print the poster, when available or the ticket on your clean white t-shirt. Remember, Dark colored shirts do not show up with process printing. It is like having black paper in your printer. We also print an image on your underwear or panties if you desire. Our return customers usually gift us packages of white t-shirts in various sizes for people that don't have white shirts with them. We usually print between 800 and 1500 t-shirts a burn, we destroy the screens when we get home, so if you get one, know that they are rare, 1 out of 700 Burners get a shirt. We have repeat  visitors that have every image since 2004. Satisfaction guaranteed or double your no money back.",

    "description": "Our theme camp's purpose is to create and display art in a variety of mediums that goes beyond being aesthetically pleasing or good feelings by eliciting intense emotions, that disrupt the viewer's state both positively and negatively, to open up new perspectives.  We strive to share art that challenges the way you see the world, with the intent to help each of us grow, as a person, both existentially and socially.\r\n\r\nArt Gallery: The gallery is a result of communal effort from artists whose creations range from stunning mandalas, life size paintings of deep subject matters both political and social, provocative photography, and psychedelic 3D paintings.  Artists will be available to talk to visitors directly about the art.\r\n\r\nFantastical Metal Sculpture Garden:  A home to a menagerie of plants and creatures, this literal sculpture garden will be a place of escape, contemplation and wonderment where the fantastical beings of our imaginations, both dark and light, are brought to life.",

In the scene, 4 Tour de France cyclists, abducted by the mafia, are smuggled into an underground gambling ring. Each cyclist is put onto a bike-like machine in front of a crowd of bettors. Each machine drives a miniature statue; the faster the cyclist pedals, the farther the statue goes along the \"course\". In the film, whenever a statue falls behind, the cyclist powering him is \"taken out back\" and you hear a loud bang. \r\n\r\nWe'll be recreating this scene. You can ride up, hook up your bike, and see if you can get your horse to the finish line first. Any cyclists that fall behind will be \"taken out back\" and shot with a water gun.\r\n\r\nTo the side of the main event, we'll have a playa dome where cyclists can change into vintage jerseys. We'll even have an area for anyone who wants to shave their legs like a TRUE CYCLIST.",

When we pursue the light we use movement, the senses, sensuality, sexuality and connection.  This beckons us in and brings the light of awareness back into the bodies we have vacated. We are particularly interested in the seat of power and intention housed in our bodies. To go there fully requires confronting our shadows. We embrace those as well as we dive into shame, fear, anger, unsavory memories from this life and past lives, and disempowering images of our bodies. Welcome home.",

In 2013, we resolved to keep our hearts, minds, and noses RED from now until the end of time! RND has roots and participants in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Santa Fe, Oregon, Canada, Israel, France, and various states and countries around the world. Our members are involved in (or are lovers of) the circus arts, and work to bring our various skills and talents to the playa in forms that allow for an immersive, participatory experience for the citizens of Black Rock City. Notable past projects/activities include: High Chair Stilt Bar, Pedalbump, Muse, Fire Wire, Wheel of Fortune, Zenobia Blanca stilt limo, Zeppelin art cars, afternoon stilt lessons, the Stoop, Whiskey Kickball, and circus variety shows of all forms!
