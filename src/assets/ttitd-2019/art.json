It is also the last bone that disintegrates, holding ritual significance in ancient cultures, as a reminder of the past and future passage that we all share. Sacra's focal point is a 'sacral object', embedded with convex mirrors reflecting our shared cellular origins; a bowed gate like a funnel for source into form;  a silhouette echoing Japanese torii gates, which traditionally indicate a passage between the profane/worldly plane to the sacred. \"Sacra\" mirrors that journey, literally and poetically, in reverse and also 'in between'.",

Because of this baggage, I feel like I can't fly, metaphorically. I'm being pulled down by my obligations and my inner immaturity.\r\n\r\nI know I'm not the only one with these issues. Each of us has baggage that weighs on us. Whether it's financial, familial or personal, these problems are at the base of each of our lives. We as a species and individually cannot grow unless we change, we cannot fly without it.\r\n\r\nSeven sins underly these problems. These are our own, personal sins and the sins of those people on whom we rely and depend.",

So finding an anthropomorphic mate who shares your life and world is an amazing surprise and fulfilling journey. Three 6 ft tall anthropomorphic SFW furry characters (called \"fursonas\") are illustrated are scattered on the Playa, and each has a mate (or mates) back at Camp Fur (at 7:30 and Echo). Each piece has a plaque with the artist and title, a description of the fursona character, their Journey, and something about their mate.\r\n\r\nCan you find the mates for each of the three mated sets?",

    "description": "Metamorphic Dis-chord is a wind-art installation offering tonal baselines for interactive features including upcycled devices for musical composition. This work adds to transformative deep playa experiences as organic playa sounds merge with human overlays. A source of deep contemplation; material used was salvaged from the Sonoma fires of 2017. Two pieces anchor the exhibit. One: an Aeolean harp, a 14ft tall string instrument based on a concept of ancient Greece and built around a trampoline salvaged from a destroyed family home. Two: a wooden windmill, 12ft tall rigged to chime via wind motion. An adjunct is a canon causing a gong to strike semi-randomly. Smaller sound and wind-active devices are hosted within the circle of the exhibit.",

As the citizens contribute to this project over the week, it will transform into a dream catcher between the dead and the living to communicate. This project is in hopes therapeutic for those who are experiencing grief but do not have the language to communicate it, like I did when I lost my older sis.",

This year BRC is home to a new civic experience - a polling place in which Burners vote for Mayor of BRC. However, it is 2019 and every important election these days experiences interference so why would anyone expect the BRC election to be different? \nBurners find the polling place during day and night by the \"Vote Here\" flag and \"Elections Fucking Matter\" neon sign. The voter enters and casts their ballot using the two electronic polling booths. However, midway through voting an incoming information operation seeks to influence the Burner's vote. Since Burners believe in radical self reliance we allow the Burner to choose who they want to influence their vote: a foreign country, social media, dark money, etc. Once the Burner has had their vote influenced they vote and pick up a custom \"I voted today\" sticker on their way out of the polling place.",

This act demonstrates and illustrates change and transformation, from slow moving compassionate movements, to dynamic transitions that are in sync, but also asynchronous. Our troupe came together exactly in this manner, we've all come from different walks of life, different circus experiences, but found commonality in the passion we have, and the passion we have for sharing, teaching, learning and collaborating with one another. The duo lyra is the first piece we've worked on together, and like us, it has also transformed and grown over the years. We'd love to perform this at Burning Man and share our passion for the community.",

As a community we can be patient and diligent, allowing synchronicity to emerge and bring each one of us to reach our full potential.

Literally on the  green fence stakes you will perchance upon almost 100 STARZ of all kinds. They are creatively concocted by 25 different people from ages 3 to 75. Each star tells a story, some are head scratchers, all are quirky. They are created with almost 100% recycled objects, repurposed items from yard sales or found objects. Your ride along the fence will most certainly be rewarded with unexpected folk art that puts a smile on your face. Discover the sounds and the open vistas the deep playa offer. Wish upon one because as we all know the playa provides.",

It is about the path to true happiness, achieved by owning the fear of dying and transforming it into the happiness of living.\r\n\r\nGot lucid?\r\n\r\nP.S.

Upon arrival to the piece the panels have hands reaching out from both the near and far end, welcoming passersby to hold. Built into each panel are windows allowing one participant to see the other through the sculpture, both holding hands, their moods create a unique display on the panels with touch enhanced sensors. Participants ponder if we are all unique or if we can find someone who is experiencing something in a similar way?",

    "description": "Performance at 10pm on Monday, August 26, 2019.\r\n\r\nFor the Burning Man 2019 Pavilion Performance, we are creating a series of dynamic aerial works, united by a shared story and theme of personal growth and transformation. These interconnected pieces explore and evoke the universal human experiences of bittersweet change, loss, conflict, and resolution. There are 5 performers, making up a series of acts, on a combination of aerial apparatus including silks, lyra (hoop), slings, rope and chains. \r\n\r\nThe piece explores themes of transformation in both positive and negative directions. We can change others for the better without seeing immediate change in ourselves. New perspective can make us leave or drive us to return. We take the lessons of a new location and new interactions and apply them back home, the same way we take the lessons and perspective of the desert back into the default world. We are transformed both by conflict and by cooperation.",

We would love to create choreography that shows the growth of shapes and form through multiple performers and the use of bringing our bodies together to create a singular form.

Five aerialists will start in separate spaces on unique elements. Slowly, as the music progresses, they will begin to notice each other and interact. The ultimate vision is to perform the transformation we go through as humans from being sad and alone to finding our place in a literal and figurative 'home.' Beyond this, we are all from different countries but make our home in Israel. As aerialists, burners and women, we share many common bonds. We want to share our hope for peace in Israel and Palestine by performing a number that ultimately shows the connections that are possible when people connect. These connections transform us. And this transformation -- from hate to love and misunderstanding to acceptance -- creates 'home.' By reaching that place physically, we can reach it emotionally.",

Its very easy to look back in hindsight and just champion the amazing results left after a transformation has occurred however the actual process of transforming is often a messy, uncomfortable, vulnerable process full of uncertainty and struggle. Our goal is to show the rawness of this process in both its pain and its glory.\r\nUltimately the whole cycle of life, from birth to death, is one never ending process of continual transformation. We symbolize this cyclical process in the show as performers move in a circular pattern from earth to sky and back again. Winding up in the same place they started again and also arriving somewhere completely new simultaneously.",

When designing it, the Notre Dame was ablaze with fire, and I thought to turn the sadness of that catastrophe, into something beautiful.

I believe in deconstructing the gender binary, that gender expression should be fluid and it is exciting for me to explore the liberating contemporary metamorphosis of gender through cabaret and aerial. \r\nIn this piece, using costume, physical theatre, clowning, drag and aerial I will explore the extreme femme - the Showgirl, against the extreme masc - the Drag King.

As the caterpillars reach the cocoon performers, the cocoons start to rise and perform the next act. When the cocoon performer reaches the butterflies, the butterflies discover their wings and begin to learn to fly. They will rise into the air and fly with hand painted large silk wings in a routine that includes flipping forward and backwards and choreographed wing dance. As the butterflies come down they will be met with their \"mate\" butterfly partner who will dance, play, and fly together in a choreographed piece symbolizing their mating. This dance will end in the death of all coming to a close.",

It has 10 pentagon shaped inward facing mirrored panels with LED patterns. The outside of the panels will have geometry based LED patterns on wood, then caged for climbability. The top face will be used for sunlight entry and will house a spinning star powered by a wind turbine, the bottom face will be used for a standing platform and human entry. The body will be off the ground, suspended by steel legs. Humans can climb into the body from the bottom and will have standing room. The visual impact from the outside will be a climbable geometric vessel. Within will be infinite patterns of light which the user becomes a part of.",

Radical inclusion is not poorly defined gender stereotypes and artificial visions that upset the moral arc of the universe bending towards realistic body shapes and non-binary gender roles. Barbie is a plastic aesthetic that degrades the Burning Man culture with a false identity and unrealistic proportions.\r\n\r\nIf we love ourselves, honor those that create love and not what defines eating disorders. If we must pretend to be others, at least let it be a revolutionary countercultural visionary. \r\n\r\nThen, like all great Burning Man art pieces, climb inside, learn about Larry, take a selfie and depart for other shiny sparkly things.",

Inspired by the incidents we witnessed at our installation and the vandalism we heard about from other artists, we realized we needed to be teachers ourselves.\r\n\r\nWe will do \"pop up\" performances out and about, with most of our programming taking place on buses or art cars. With a \"learning is fun\" mindset, we'll use quizzes, reenactments and songs to impart tips and tricks designed to embed the principles into your very soul.",

You push one of the five pulsing arcade-style buttons on top of the crate and lean into a microphone: \"Bah dum dum kah! Dum da dum kah!\". You let go of the button and your fresh beat continues on loop. Your friends each take a turn and together you make a joyous cacophony of silliness! \r\n\r\nBurning Man shifts the paradigm of art from a commodified object of consumption to an interactive, participatory, shared experience of creative expression. Everyone loves music, but many people have never experienced the joy of making music. This piece illustrates how easy and fun that process can be.",

Maybe everyone lives in different realities. Talking Heads can show the power of imagination to lead us into a metaphysical and magical experience of metamorphosis.",

Linearity also reflects the passage of life; all lives have a beginning, a middle and an end which metaphorically is included in this temple's form. Following this metaphor a variety of spaces are created; narrow spaces and wide spaces, dark spaces and bright spaces. Tunnels  create intimate experiences with shade.. A large central hall expands in width and height providing a bright area suitable for gatherings.",

The body and face create a blank canvas for expression.  Throughout the week the figures are customized, culminating in a transformative burn. The piece is a visual metaphor contemplating conformity through shared non-conformity. People, from a distance may appear homogeneous but once among them you see their individuality. Through shared experience burners are altered and stretched by the thoughts and intentions of one another and then transformed through an expression of impermanence.",

The Bees are bronze in colour, but on their dancing feet they wear gleaming copper ballet shoes with copper ribbons. The Bees are transformed into dancers.",

During the day Burners see their reflections evolve inside the fragmented mirrors as they move through the sand winds and find shelter in its corners and covers. At sunrise and sunset the installation invites for meditation. Burners ascend and descend the central staircase experiencing a golden hue of warmth from the sun. At night, \"Fragments\" shifts again into abstract LED surfaces creating a magical apparition in the desert darkness.",

Time, in this piece, is a paradox and an illusion as it combines the future and the past, simultaneously presenting a quantitative measuring system with a qualitative one.\r\n\r\nThe concept illustrates how motion and time change according to our perceptions. It represents the evolution of time management and our obsession with the passage of time. It suggests to the observer that all matter may shrink into a tiny dot again, which will end the concept of time as we know it. This sculpture is to discover ways to distort time, exaggerate perceptions or to embellish the estimation of time, all within the shifting sands of playa time.",

The giant fireflies are made of steel, and have transformed to truly become _fire_flies. Was it magic? Radioactive bugs? Ancient cursed jar? \r\nThere are up to 24 buttons to be pushed to produce a variety of flame effects, and FLG's signature liquid shooter will be sending 50' colored flames in the sky.",

The head rests in repose while its left hand claws at its mind fighting to reveal a crystalline stained glass structure akin to the \"Space Whale\" inside.\r\n\r\nA series of hidden doors in the mouth, wrists and head open into a four story, 18 room maze. Each modular room creates a unique space dedicated to the nature of our minds, our struggles with being and the weird and fanciful process of dreaming.",

And the structure doubles as a giant shade structure, where people can push through the stepped skin to shaded terraces at the rear, or shelter beneath them.",

It stands on a platform of stones and the set is surrounded by laser engraved Plexiglass Sheets with images based on Sacred Geometry. The project comes to life at night with a programmed LED system positioned at the edges of the acrylic. It creates the illusion of a continuous movement of TORUS.\r\nInteractive lighting changes to a rainbow, representing the energy collected by the vortex. \r\nThe sculpture's hypnotic current affects brain waves as they drop into the ebb and flow of ancient rhythms. At sunrise, each day, an envoy from the institute will perform ceremonies focusing on water energy purification. \r\nAs participants meditate, they send frequencies that are then reflected in the water's quantum structure, which will be photographed before and after Burning Man.",

The sculpture will incorporate large wood birds made from reclaimed wood beams salvaged from a demolished commercial building. We will resurface the beams down to a restored finish. Large custom bearing plates will be incorporated at each balance point of the birds that will rotate independently allowing the sculpture to slide in the wind. The axis of the piece will stretch ascending linearly in orientation to the Man. A large steel metal feather will sit at the forward apex of the sculpture symbolizing the fragility of the balance. The kinetic sculpture will honor the migration and the collaborative movement of nature and its processes.",

The carousel looks hellish, but when it starts to move and emit light and sound, it becomes a celebration of creativity and the irrepressible ecstasy of life. If humanity itself can learn to produce light and love, it will be able to continue even after a societal collapse. That's why the Carousel Zarya is hand-powered: the person himself becomes the main driver of movement, joy and life in general.",

Benches provide places to gather, rest, and commune with other Burners.\r\n\r\nAt night, the spectrum of color expands.

Spoken words, hand claps, performances on musical instruments, and all other sounds made within the installation are rewarded with a lush, surround-sound response as they are echoed throughout the space by a number of small pillars rising above the playa's surface, scattered across an area approximately 60 feet in diameter.",

Some may choose to try out both of these modes of engagement thereby switching between the roles of the magician (the illusion-maker or fascinator) and the spectator (the perceiver or the one fascinated).",

In 2019, we will be doing 2 or 3 figures with no fire due to funding limitations. It is our plan moving forward to build more figures each year until the circle is complete!",

Genie is embedded in our consciousness as a creative, intelligent, mythological, guardian spirit. His role is to make dreams come true allowing something to happen that can't be stopped. At the base of the genie's feet is a giant Book of Wishes. Participants use this to write out their dreams. Its a place to acknowledge wishes as affirmations of how we imagine our best selves into being. Genie allows us to have no restrictions on our requests. Dreams are not just your own, they are connected with everyone else. It's about nuances of communication. My hope is that participants will connect with Genie to affirm their best selves into being.",

We should not let the elephants go extinct. If you take one element away from the ecosystem it will affect all the other creatures including humans themselves!\r\n\r\nSlonik — transliteration from Cyrillic — is the diminutive form of a Russian word that means elephant.",

    "description": "\"Still Alive\" is a heptagonal wooden structure covered with acrylic mirror sheets that generate a highly sensory interactive atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThis art piece projects and receives light through its entrances and skylights that are in synchrony with the sounds and the light that is emitted. It reflects the landscape of the desert from its exterior layers and an infinite universe in the interior.\r\n\r\nThus, this static installation mixes images from the surroundings in its mirrors and the trajectory of the sun combined with the vibrating pulse of Burning Man giving a semblance of a living form, as a metaphor of the cycle of life.",

    "description": "Divine Feminine Warrior Goddess - Reclaiming Your Crown (DFWG) represents 4 facets of a woman's essence. DFWG consists of 4 female torso forms. Each is decorated uniquely to represent the artist's vision of Divine, Feminine, Warrior and Goddess. The torsos act as \"guards\" to the Pyramid, which contains a raised Throne in the center. In keeping with the metamorphosis theme, it asks the viewer to sit on the Throne and reflect on how they have grown and evolved to empower and express these traits of DFWG within themselves. The Throne is facing westward in alignment with a view of the Man, the mountains and the setting sun. It is designed to help facilitate the participant to embrace her self-worth and reclaim her power as the Goddess she is.",

This piece celebrates collaboration by encouraging impromptu ensembles to explore composition as a shared experience.  And, it invites musicians to step inside the music they create.",
