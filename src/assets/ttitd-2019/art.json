Jung stated, \"there is no coming to consciousness without pain\", and this installation represents the process and struggle to become whole; by combining conscious and unconscious elements. The  balance anima and animus, yin and yang.\r\n\r\nIndividuation is the lifelong process of the differentiation of the Self. In the reflection, a glimpse into our own self and the process or metamorphisis of becoming whole (holy).\r\n\r\nIts mirror polished steel will enables us to reflect on our Self and  \"meet ourselves on the path of life. And or those with the eyes to see it, the every present reality of Synchronicity.\r\n\r\nUntil you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life, and you will call it fate.  Thus, reflecting on 'Individuation' enables us to meet future friends, thanks to Synchronicity. Reminding us \"It's a poor sort of memory that only works backwards\".",

The sacrum (= 'holy bone') is the first gateway through which we metamorphize from space to substance, into the wordly realm. It is also the last bone that disintegrates, holding ritual significance in ancient cultures, as a reminder of the past and future passage that we all share. Sacra's focal point is a 'sacral object', embedded with convex mirrors reflecting our shared cellular origins; a bowed gate like a funnel for source into form;  a silhouette echoing Japanese torii gates, which traditionally indicate a passage between the profane/worldly plane to the sacred. \"Sacra\" mirrors that journey, literally and poetically, in reverse and also 'in between'.",

Indulge in a daily dose of truth and humor as the message on the marquee board changes daily.

Much of the heteronormative default world expects to find their match in life. In contrast, for furries (and many non-default peoples), we grew up with a feeling of being perennial outsiders in our own society. So finding an anthropomorphic mate who shares your life and world is an amazing surprise and fulfilling journey. Three 6 ft tall anthropomorphic SFW furry characters (called \"fursonas\") are illustrated are scattered on the Playa, and each has a mate (or mates) back at Camp Fur (at 7:30 and Echo). Each piece has a plaque with the artist and title, a description of the fursona character, their Journey, and something about their mate.\r\n\r\nCan you find the mates for each of the three mated sets?",

Here she was adopted by the Tea & Crumpets collective, who were mystified and much astounded with this enigmatic apparition. Through a coalescence of luck and goodwill, the Radical Ritual of Re-manifestation was conceived; a retreat to the ether to replenish their energies and multiply their numbers. As time went on, each congress led to a doubling of the cohort...and a growing confidence among these shy yet somehow fun loving creatures to be closer to the gatherings of the humans. Their recent sojourn to their one of their ancestral homelands  in South Africa led to a commitment that if they could, they would attempt the long transatlantic flight this year.\"  Prototype Ursula\r\n\r\nThe Flock will be distributed around Black Rock City at various custodian camps; each has it's own name and characteristics.

They can also hang handmade objects and trinkets with their messages. \r\n\r\nDaily performances by Yves Gore + Frank Fu and FU Institute will also be held at the Wake sculpture. \r\n\r\nThe sculpture will be triangular, made with 6 poles along with a stand that is placed in the middle and will light up at night. As the citizens contribute to this project over the week, it will transform into a dream catcher between the dead and the living to communicate. This project is in hopes therapeutic for those who are experiencing grief but do not have the language to communicate it, like I did when I lost my older sis.",

    "description": "BRC has many esteemed civic institutions; Burners participate in the Census,  read the paper, and get the requisite permits from the DMV. This year BRC is home to a new civic experience - a polling place in which Burners vote for Mayor of BRC. However, it is 2019 and every important election these days experiences interference so why would anyone expect the BRC election to be different? \nBurners find the polling place during day and night by the \"Vote Here\" flag and \"Elections Fucking Matter\" neon sign. The voter enters and casts their ballot using the two electronic polling booths. However, midway through voting an incoming information operation seeks to influence the Burner's vote. Since Burners believe in radical self reliance we allow the Burner to choose who they want to influence their vote: a foreign country, social media, dark money, etc. Once the Burner has had their vote influenced they vote and pick up a custom \"I voted today\" sticker on their way out of the polling place.",

This act demonstrates and illustrates change and transformation, from slow moving compassionate movements, to dynamic transitions that are in sync, but also asynchronous. Our troupe came together exactly in this manner, we've all come from different walks of life, different circus experiences, but found commonality in the passion we have, and the passion we have for sharing, teaching, learning and collaborating with one another. The duo lyra is the first piece we've worked on together, and like us, it has also transformed and grown over the years. We'd love to perform this at Burning Man and share our passion for the community.",

As a community we can be patient and diligent, allowing synchronicity to emerge and bring each one of us to reach our full potential. People are currently experiencing disconnect from one another, as we all have to hustle so hard to keep a roof over our heads. We so often forget to turn to one another in times of need.

It is a reminder to both not take ourselves too seriously and also to ALWAYS look around us \u2014 you never know what you may miss if you don't. The hand-painted letters B-O-R-I-N-G are fabricated from reclaimed sheet metal and discarded retail sign parts, and lit by 300 ten-watt incandescent bulbs and securely attached to a welded base with wheels.

Each star tells a story, some are head scratchers, all are quirky. They are created with almost 100% recycled objects, repurposed items from yard sales or found objects. Your ride along the fence will most certainly be rewarded with unexpected folk art that puts a smile on your face. Discover the sounds and the open vistas the deep playa offer.

I am a professional therapist by training and whether they get professional advice or very nonprofessional suggestions will be contingent on their issues.  During the times that I am not there, this bench can be used as a buddy bench.  If someone sees another sitting on the bench, it is an opportunity to take a seat and make a friend.

    "description": "Beneath a glowing pyramid, a seasoned meditator sits peacefully in lotus position, wearing an EEG (brainwave) headset. As their meditation deepens, the pyramid pulses and responds. \r\n\r\nHuge fractal-art blooms, controlled by the meditator's brainwaves, are projected onto the pyramid walls. A glittering EEG chandelier cascades color and light from the pyramid's pinnacle down toward the meditator, whose brainwaves control a lush soundscape sampled from animal voices, sacred tunes, synths and murmuring Burner voices. \r\n\r\nMind Murmur shares the power and beauty of meditation, focusing on interconnection, collective experience, and non\u2010locality of consciousness. It's sublime to experience while meditating, and while wandering the playa.",

Can our fleeting actions ultimately stack up to monumental outcomes?\r\n\r\nThe piece, built by first-time playa artists, consists of a 26 ft spire, with ornate star-patterned walls. It shines like a Moroccan lantern at night, and beckons viewers to rest in a plush interior, seek shade, duck a windstorm. It incubates change.

It slows down to show off the intense desire for a relationship to express loneliness. The act ends with more dynamic movement expressing excitement, motivation and passion!\r\n\r\nI'll Take Care of You Act-\r\nThis act is a more personal routine. Intended to express the hurt, loss of trust, and loneliness of a loss.. and the journey of being true to yourself and building up your self empowerment.

These interconnected pieces explore and evoke the universal human experiences of bittersweet change, loss, conflict, and resolution. There are 5 performers, making up a series of acts, on a combination of aerial apparatus including silks, lyra (hoop), slings, rope and chains. \r\n\r\nThe piece explores themes of transformation in both positive and negative directions. We can change others for the better without seeing immediate change in ourselves. New perspective can make us leave or drive us to return. We take the lessons of a new location and new interactions and apply them back home, the same way we take the lessons and perspective of the desert back into the default world. We are transformed both by conflict and by cooperation.",

The box is a place to sit by the numbers, look out on the playa, reflect on their significance. \n\nThis art piece represents sexual equality. No matter how you identify or your sexual preference, this position is universal amongst all humans. It's an equal exchange of power and celebrates the rare occasion of giving and receiving at the same time. \n\nInteractivity: participants can interact with the project by leaving us a note on the box. The box is unfinished wood and we will leave markers/pencils out for these notes. We invite participants to write a note sharing their personal story related to 69.",

We can overlook examine this process, but it is the sometimes monstrous, uncomfortable phase that leads us to the glorious breakthrough. It *is* metamorphosis. \r\n\r\nMy act is depicting the chrysalis itself; the change as it's happening, the weird and awkward growing pain that we sometimes shun in the moment but are so grateful for after the growth has led us to wisdom and experience.",

Five aerialists will start in separate spaces on unique elements. Slowly, as the music progresses, they will begin to notice each other and interact. The ultimate vision is to perform the transformation we go through as humans from being sad and alone to finding our place in a literal and figurative 'home.' Beyond this, we are all from different countries but make our home in Israel. As aerialists, burners and women, we share many common bonds. We want to share our hope for peace in Israel and Palestine by performing a number that ultimately shows the connections that are possible when people connect. These connections transform us. And this transformation -- from hate to love and misunderstanding to acceptance -- creates 'home.' By reaching that place physically, we can reach it emotionally.",

Its very easy to look back in hindsight and just champion the amazing results left after a transformation has occurred however the actual process of transforming is often a messy, uncomfortable, vulnerable process full of uncertainty and struggle. Our goal is to show the rawness of this process in both its pain and its glory.\r\nUltimately the whole cycle of life, from birth to death, is one never ending process of continual transformation. We symbolize this cyclical process in the show as performers move in a circular pattern from earth to sky and back again. Winding up in the same place they started again and also arriving somewhere completely new simultaneously.",

It sits behind the Artist as a supporting act, illuminating the more spiritual side of the music we all love. When designing it, the Notre Dame was ablaze with fire, and I thought to turn the sadness of that catastrophe, into something beautiful. Its lines were borrowed from the famous Rose Sud that sits above the entrance. Whenever the Mandala is present it's meant to create a more sacred space and radiate splendid emotion.",

I believe in deconstructing the gender binary, that gender expression should be fluid and it is exciting for me to explore the liberating contemporary metamorphosis of gender through cabaret and aerial. \r\nIn this piece, using costume, physical theatre, clowning, drag and aerial I will explore the extreme femme - the Showgirl, against the extreme masc - the Drag King. I'll dress up and strip down as either character and the act concludes as I assimilate both archetypes.",

We think this classic piece of our repertoire would be framed perfectly in the arches under the man. It transforms depending on the performers we choose to inhabit it. We will be referencing the first law of Thermodynamics - \"Energy can be transformed from one form to another, but can be neither created nor destroyed.\" As the orb rotates, it spins passively and then is reinvigorated by each layer of self that exits the shape. First the layer of family is shed, then romantic love and then self. Like peeling an onion, each layer is shed until the only thing left is the vibrating inner core - empty and universal.",

They begin their performance rising in a lyra/hoop where they'll perform a choreographed routine with symbolic bendy caterpillar moves and flexibility movement. As the caterpillars reach the cocoon performers, the cocoons start to rise and perform the next act. When the cocoon performer reaches the butterflies, the butterflies discover their wings and begin to learn to fly. They will rise into the air and fly with hand painted large silk wings in a routine that includes flipping forward and backwards and choreographed wing dance. As the butterflies come down they will be met with their \"mate\" butterfly partner who will dance, play, and fly together in a choreographed piece symbolizing their mating. This dance will end in the death of all coming to a close",

Our phone booth structure is inspired by traditional Japanese Shoji screens and resembles a large Japanese lantern.

Under each piece is a bench back to sit and lean against. Within this six sided circular structure there is no beginning or end. The wind speaks to those who will listen via the structure. Resonating chambers, strings, and chimes bathe the environment in sound illustrating the interconnected nature of the universe via the principles of sympathetic resonance and kinetic motion. Night views include a subtle changing lightscape that casts colorful shadows on the playa.",

The ideal gas law PV=nRT is at the heart of good espresso.

Experiences already lived through can't be erased, but they can speak their truths, and be let go.

You push one of the five pulsing arcade-style buttons on top of the crate and lean into a microphone: \"Bah dum dum kah! Dum da dum kah!\". You let go of the button and your fresh beat continues on loop. Your friends each take a turn and together you make a joyous cacophony of silliness! \r\n\r\nBurning Man shifts the paradigm of art from a commodified object of consumption to an interactive, participatory, shared experience of creative expression. Everyone loves music, but many people have never experienced the joy of making music. This piece illustrates how easy and fun that process can be.",

At its a heart is a community space produced by a community of artists for the community to interact on. Circus Fabulae is at its core an interactive art piece that fosters  participation from the community. First, it brings together a variety of artists to  design the swings and mosaic ceiling, then it provides the residents of Black Rock a place to rest and play during the festival and finally, it is a performance space for all kinds of mediums (dance, theater, games, music, spoken word) that encourages one to push personal boundaries and deepen one's connection to the community at large.",

The light shines downward highlighting the empty swing in an invitation for passersby to enjoy its delights. Once the swing is occupied the transformation and color begins to glow.

Each figure has skin of white wax and a unique 3D printed face created by a point-cloud scan of real people.  At night an internal LED creates a glow emanating from within. The body and face create a blank canvas for expression.  Throughout the week the figures are customized, culminating in a transformative burn. The piece is a visual metaphor contemplating conformity through shared non-conformity. People, from a distance may appear homogeneous but once among them you see their individuality. Through shared experience burners are altered and stretched by the thoughts and intentions of one another and then transformed through an expression of impermanence.",

Some of the early blooms that have yet to fully mature may be scaled down and yet to reach their full height.",

It celebrates one of the most fascinating examples of communication in the natural world \u2014 when forager bees return from their exploratory flights and perform the Bee Dance for the other bees, carrying out specific routines in order to communicate the distance and direction of pollen, nectar and water from the hive. \r\n\r\nBee Dance is a strong climbable structure that Burners can clamber over and cling to, just as pollen clings to a bee. The Bees are bronze in colour, but on their dancing feet they wear gleaming copper ballet shoes with copper ribbons. The Bees are transformed into dancers.",

Here, they find an ornate metal wheel that controls the intensity of the tornado.  \r\n\r\nThe pillar of fire in the desert is an ancient symbol of knowledge and immediacy. Theophany evokes this meme while adding the power of lightning, to both dazzle and amaze. In addition, it gifts control of this power into human hands, allowing a blurring of roles between mortal and divine.",

During the day Burners see their reflections evolve inside the fragmented mirrors as they move through the sand winds and find shelter in its corners and covers. At sunrise and sunset the installation invites for meditation. Burners ascend and descend the central staircase experiencing a golden hue of warmth from the sun. At night, \"Fragments\" shifts again into abstract LED surfaces creating a magical apparition in the desert darkness.",

Pipes mounted into the structure will shoot fire up into the air coordinated with every keystroke. The Kethedral will be adorned with stained glass lighted by flame rail pilots creating a tabernacle of fire and light. LED lighting will amplify the visual effect of the fire and sound.",

With a ring 12' in diameter made from 4,608 stained glass tiles with a total of 24 colors, graduating the color wheel in a flowing mosaic that is two sided. Two 7-thousand-pound basalt stone columns stand guard from the left and from the right. Portal will also be lit with an increasing laser light show controlled on a theremin device, with sound effects that go off when one enters.\r\n\r\nSymbiosis.\r\n\r\nThe color in harmony attracts vitality through beauty, like a flower does a bee. The bee gets food in exchange for spreading pollen. In the same manner one attracts to Portal. Coming out with powerful frequencies, to bounce off their friends, their family, the animals, EARTH, and even so called... \"enemies.\"",

Although it has enabled innovation and permeated human culture around the world, the consequences of using this seemingly magical material without due diligence are becoming clear.",

Time, in this piece, is a paradox and an illusion as it combines the future and the past, simultaneously presenting a quantitative measuring system with a qualitative one.\r\n\r\nThe concept illustrates how motion and time change according to our perceptions. It represents the evolution of time management and our obsession with the passage of time. It suggests to the observer that all matter may shrink into a tiny dot again, which will end the concept of time as we know it. This sculpture is to discover ways to distort time, exaggerate perceptions or to embellish the estimation of time, all within the shifting sands of playa time.",

Other than its size, the machine resembles its smaller cousin, but with some important differences. Rather than resting on legs, the sides extend all the way to the ground, creating a useful storage and service area underneath. The plywood skin is coated in hand painted graphics, reflecting an earlier era in pinball history with a steampunk flare. In keeping with the steampunk theme, the lights glow in green and yellow tones illuminating brass and copper components beneath a clear polycarbonate surface. Rolling between the bumpers and flippers, a three inch chrome ball puts points on the board where winners are born.",

The head towers four stories over the playa floor, encased in mulberry paper and epoxy modeled after the work of Yoshio Ikezaki. The head rests in repose while its left hand claws at its mind fighting to reveal a crystalline stained glass structure akin to the \"Space Whale\" inside.\r\n\r\nA series of hidden doors in the mouth, wrists and head open into a four story, 18 room maze. Each modular room creates a unique space dedicated to the nature of our minds, our struggles with being and the weird and fanciful process of dreaming.",

It offers an organic, informal take on the traditional amphitheatre - enabling an audience or horde of dancers to focus on an event or group or person - or sound car - that might choose to occupy its centre; in return, anyone at its centre becomes surrounded by a wall of humans, each occupying the undulating landscapes in unique ways. \r\nThe structure aligns with the cosmos and celebrates the sunrise, midday and sunset rays of light that slice through it, as if on a giant sundial. And the structure doubles as a giant shade structure, where people can push through the stepped skin to shaded terraces at the rear, or shelter beneath them.",

In year one, a sky-facing comma will emerge and form a love letter altar.

The back side of the home has the illusion of being completely exposed to open playa, but is enclosed with clear acrylic paneling. This allows citizens of Black Rock City to see the illuminated structure, and the people inside, from afar. Each room has a unique interactive sound installation, which plays off the concept of a seance gone wrong. The Dollhouse transports participants to an ethereal world on playa, captivating and enticing all to play and discover more secrets within.",

The carousel looks hellish, but when it starts to move and emit light and sound, it becomes a celebration of creativity and the irrepressible ecstasy of life. If humanity itself can learn to produce light and love, it will be able to continue even after a societal collapse. That's why the Carousel Zarya is hand-powered: the person himself becomes the main driver of movement, joy and life in general.",

Some of the things our projects is meant to provide include but are nor limited to: shade from the sun, shelter from the dust, a place for people to gather and communicate, a place to rest, a place for sound reduction, a meeting point, or a landmark. \r\n\r\nThis project was our gift to the participants of Burning Man DaVinci's Workshop in 2016. It is given as a small token of our appreciation for all the fantastic people and their wonderful creations that we have shared.",

    "description": "\"Fascination\" is defined by the OED as either the \"casting of a spell; sorcery, enchantment,\" or \"the state of being under a spell.\" Magic and optical illusions require interaction from spectators to exist. Fascination gives wanderers of the playa the opportunity to engage with it passively (by watching its magic effect from afar) or actively (by using their own muscles to power the illusion for others). Some may choose to try out both of these modes of engagement thereby switching between the roles of the magician (the illusion-maker or fascinator) and the spectator (the perceiver or the one fascinated).",

Tzompantli is a Nahuatl word, the language of the Aztecs, and the largest one was in the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan.  It was 60 by 30 meters, several meters tall, and contained an estimated 60,000 skulls.  \r\n\r\nThis BRC tzompantli is a replica of the ancient ones.

It has no meaning other than a love for creating, re-purposing past creations and the progressing of an acronym. How simple is that?\r\nThe piece is covered with over 1500 LED pixels controlled by a Teensy controller. A disco ball flashes will provide a means of locating it from across the playa.\r\nAlso it will provide the viewer a means to control of the animation and speed. The configuration and covering will provide some shade during the heat of the day and a visual impact during the night.\r\nThe ecological impact will be low due to the use of solar panels and batteries.",

The large pipe juts up from the playa at a very low angle. It ends at eye height. Below it's opening a small podium awaits.  As the participant reaches out to touch the podium, they will notice a soft musical sound starting to emit. If they move their hand closer to the antenna, the pitch of the sound will rise, and as they move their hand away the pitch will fall. The experience will be the interface of a traditional theramin, but with a more real, physical sound in lieu of the traditional synthesized sound.",

It is physical and real, yet completely magical at the same time. The display showcases several interesting physics: magnetic force and magnetization, fluid mechanics, surface tension and gravity.",

Printing out life-size images gives the full effect of what it looks like and feels like to capture these people in that moment. After all, WE ARE Burning Man !",

Genie is embedded in our consciousness as a creative, intelligent, mythological, guardian spirit. His role is to make dreams come true allowing something to happen that can't be stopped. At the base of the genie's feet is a giant Book of Wishes. Participants use this to write out their dreams. Its a place to acknowledge wishes as affirmations of how we imagine our best selves into being. Genie allows us to have no restrictions on our requests. Dreams are not just your own, they are connected with everyone else. It's about nuances of communication. My hope is that participants will connect with Genie to affirm their best selves into being.",

Hanging from the branches are sea buoys and balls providing a place to write names or leave a message to those who will come after. \r\n\r\nHanging from branches are bamboo wind chimes that softly clatter in the breeze. It is an island, a refuge, a place of calm and childhood in the stormy seas of life. It appears out of the playa as a mirage, the fantasy playground of youth.

    "description": "I would like to bring my childhood joy of books and climbing trees to the playa by building a tree library. A comfy armchair will be in the nest at the top for folks to read in, shaded with branches. It will look like an old organic library with bookshelves, staircases and books stacked all over it. Recessed shelves will be hidden in the trunk and books will have light up letters, inspiring words and pop-up images inside. There is a playful childlike energy to the piece. The Bard's Branch will bring joy & stir the imagination.",

As you approach, two human forms push and pull luggage against resistance while a third heaves a suitcase onto a long entry wall not made of bricks or sticks, but of baggage.  Some are open and display the artifacts of identity and a sign states, \"Everyone has a story to tell.\" \r\n\r\nYou enter the circle and are greeted by 108 blank human forms and scattered permanent markers as invitation.  A center hub holds an integrated center, where dialogue converges with a human form costumed as the creative forces of the universe.  Three wise children at play lead you out of the circle through wings and a sign that says, \"Now you are Free.\"\r\n\r\nProgressive, participative, metamorphosis.",

Each is decorated uniquely to represent the artist's vision of Divine, Feminine, Warrior and Goddess. The torsos act as \"guards\" to the Pyramid, which contains a raised Throne in the center. In keeping with the metamorphosis theme, it asks the viewer to sit on the Throne and reflect on how they have grown and evolved to empower and express these traits of DFWG within themselves. The Throne is facing westward in alignment with a view of the Man, the mountains and the setting sun. It is designed to help facilitate the participant to embrace her self-worth and reclaim her power as the Goddess she is.",
