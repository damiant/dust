Whether they want to make signs for personal expression, camp use, public statements, camp decorations, sign replacement, or any other practical or impractical use for a sign. We come prepared with blank wood in various sizes, and pre-cut street signs that are painted with a white base, so that we can quickly create new street signs that have gone missing.",

Over the last 4,000+ years, the preparation, serving, and enjoyment of tea has evolved into a meditative and social experience that teaches us that something alchemical and magical can happen when two seemingly unrelated elements are brought together in a warm, inviting space, allowed to soak each other up, and co-create a new flavor. Our aim is to gift fellow burners with this experience by lovingly and intentionally creating a space that invites guests to come in, soak each other up through radical self-expression, and leave reminded of our interconnectivity.",

In the social, accessible and egalitarian tradition of Roman baths, our camp features an amphitheater with communal steam rooms. Designed by Arthur Mamou-Mani, the camp is a place for art, performance, meditation, discussion, and transcendental sauna experiences where all are welcome to participate! Catharsis' interactive program generates self-revelation and fosters deep connections on a collective and environmental level. With new perspectives and insight, we have the potential to reimagine our future cities and how we can thrive within them, aligning our ways of being with sustainable living, nature and creativity.",

At Hoochie Coochie you can explore the vessel of birth and drink from a voluptuous vulva if you can find the right button. Then wander towards \"Love You to Death\", your living wake. From birth to earth, slip into the silky sanctum of your very own coffin and be ravished with words by the ones who'd rather have their love for you fall on living ears. From woody box to wooden box, from vag to urn, from the first vestibule we experience at birth, to the final vestibule at death, our camp will give citizens of BRC an experience of Metamorphosis, celebrating the birth and death of transformation.",

The Antevasin was not of the villager's anymore, nor was he yet a transcendent - one of the sages who live deep in the unexplored woods, fully realized.  The Antevasin was an in-betweener - a border dweller, living in sight of both worlds but looking towards the unknown.\r\n\r\nWe constantly move between student and teacher, seeker and master.

We offer amazing experiential and experimental workshops that allow you to feel your feminine heart your radiance your inner goddess. This work requires the masculine as well; Everyone is welcome.\n\nAt Naked Heart we recognize the need to embrace both the light and the dark in our journeys. When we pursue the light we use movement, the senses, sensuality, sexuality and connection.  This beckons us in and brings the light of awareness back into the bodies we have vacated. We are particularly interested in the seat of power and intention housed in our bodies. To go there fully requires confronting our shadows. We embrace those as well as we dive into shame, fear, anger, unsavory memories from this life and past lives.",

Alkalita provides a funky, social cantina environment where people can mingle and dance to 80's Yacht Rock music while sipping a cold margarita. Alkalita also provides a valuable service to all Burners by providing fresh alkaline batteries that we all so depend on.\r\n\r\nThat's Alkalita...engaging, inviting, and in servitude to our fellow Burners.\r\n\r\nWe will be open Monday through Thursday from 11:30pm - 12:30pm and from 4:30pm - 6:30pm\r\n\r\nWe so hope you'll drop by and see us!",

The Color Commons addresses the question \"How to create a sense of place in a temporary city that is in a constant state of metamorphosis?\" by using the most ephemeral of materials: silk, color, and air. Simple in design but dramatic in nature, hand-dyed banners beckon from across the playa, create a kinetic silken environment, and provide ever-changing views of the city. In the center of the installation is the Prism, a 14-foot-tall triangular structure whose interior space envelops the participant in a quietude rarely experienced on playa. We hope you will love your interaction with The Color Commons as much as we have loved creating it. We wish you an epic Burning Man 2019!",

Interactive elements and structures help to explore the avenues of possible combinations between physical and spiritual values within comfortable but confined situation with it's false freedom and artificial peace. You can enter the gilded cage with it's playground of a slat swing, comfy floor pillows and bath accessories and enjoy it's superficially attractive but nevertheless constraining space you reevaluate your freedom by changing your perspective between being outside or inside of the cage.",

At Nice Nice we take an old-school approach to Burning Man -- interacting and connecting one-on-one, person-to-person.   You're invited to come by anytime to Bang the Gongs or Jam on the Rimba Pipes. Or join us around our camp fire in the evening. Check out our evening Fireside Chats,  each featuring a different host, who will offer some remarks on their chosen topic, and then open the conversation up to all. The Fireside Chat schedule will be posted in front of the camp.",

We view art as intrinsically collaborative – the playa allows us to collaborate directly with residents of BRC.\r\nThe 5 story Firehouse bar is the most recognizable symbol of Do-More-Now.

Bring your own instrument and we'll mic it! Explore the powerful, multi-user, spatially integrated interface that enables complex live-looping musical and visual production. The week long session is recorded for posterity, and may be re-lived post-burn. Visit http://synaesthesia.camp for happenings, video demos, and perhaps to book the space for a special event you would like to host in the space (i.e. synaesthetic sound healing, choreographed dance/light/sound performance, etc.)",

Established in 2008 and designed to resemble the most garish of '60s roadside motels,  we are dedicated to sharing the spirit and ethos of the noble flamingo.  We're a flamboyance of fun-loving goofballs from all over the country (and all across the gender and sexuality spectra) who invite weary travelers to stop in for a snow cone and enjoy featured music and activities every day while lounging in the shade by our \"pool\".   Since we have become a pretty close knit group we are only looking to bring in people that want to join our family, stay long term, and be productive, dynamic members of our tribe, so membership is limited and by sponsorship of 2 current members.",

We are huge advocates of Flow, the timeless, selfless, expressive state of being, when our inner critic is silenced and our highest self comes to play. We're a family and community, a California-based collective of dreamers, artists, adventurers, and passionate doers, that loves throwing badass parties as much as we love to connect on deeper levels. We are professionals at being, playing, and faffing about - whether it's dancing, music, yoga, fire spinning, cooking, making art, or a whole lot of nonsense. We're a diverse group of eclectic individuals that operates with deep love and respect on the 10 Principles of Burning Man, that create interactive and magical experiences together as we inspire others to dance, flow, love, and be their free and fearless selves. What is your flow?",
