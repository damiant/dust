Over the last 4,000+ years, the preparation, serving, and enjoyment of tea has evolved into a meditative and social experience that teaches us that something alchemical and magical can happen when two seemingly unrelated elements are brought together in a warm, inviting space, allowed to soak each other up, and co-create a new flavor. Our aim is to gift fellow burners with this experience by lovingly and intentionally creating a space that invites guests to come in, soak each other up through radical self-expression, and leave reminded of our interconnectivity.",

In our central Ashram we host events, workshops, discussions, and music that allow us to set our intentions, collaborate, and discuss how to shape our futures. Our camp realizes the importance that having a healthy mind, body, and spirit are needed to realize the intentions we set, thus we serve elixirs, meals and host an array of meditation, yoga, and spiritual ceremonies to invigorate us and provide the foundation for collaboration and discussion.",

Don't worry, they come in peace(ish).  They just want to convert you into one of them! They'll do this by inviting you through their wormhole and into their space shuttle to undergo a metamorphic HUMAN TO SPACE CAT SOUND BATH.

Mr. Darwin thinks that whales may be bears which have enormously increased their bulk, washed their paws into fins by constant swimming, and stretched their mouths by keeping them open to catch insects in the water. So also he thinks that men and women may have been developed out of monkeys, monkeys out of mushrooms, and mushrooms out of \" monads,\" or little clots of jelly. Where is the proof? Where is a single instance of a bearwhale, or a man-monkey, to be seen? Of course there is not one.",

The Color Commons addresses the question \"How to create a sense of place in a temporary city that is in a constant state of metamorphosis?\" by using the most ephemeral of materials: silk, color, and air. Simple in design but dramatic in nature, hand-dyed banners beckon from across the playa, create a kinetic silken environment, and provide ever-changing views of the city. In the center of the installation is the Prism, a 14-foot-tall triangular structure whose interior space envelops the participant in a quietude rarely experienced on playa. We hope you will love your interaction with The Color Commons as much as we have loved creating it. We wish you an epic Burning Man 2019!",

While we will continue to offer the best view or BRC, we are also becoming a home, a platform and a connecting place for people looking to create and transform their lives and the world we live in. This takes a lot of forms, from healing practices to conversations to new experiences to connecting and translating across all the things we know, and all the things we don't. But it's all here, somewhere, maybe right in front of us. Maybe what we dismissed as magic speaks to the possibility of how it all actually works, and has the whole time. What if we can literally just make it up because we get that? Because we can.",

Over next few years they convinced many of their friends to join them out in the desert.  Much merriment was had, and in 1994 Fandango proper was born. Over the years our Village has grown to at times include the SLO-Orbitals, MoTown, Butterzone, Haiku-for-Beer, The Blight and other sub camps.\nSo now we are a big ole village with members spread all over. Nothing has changed, and everything has changed. These are our people. We are our people. Welcome to Fandango. Be sure to say hello when you stop by for a beer!",

So we here at Camp Dusty Justice are celebrating that practice and bringing an open, slightly impartial, fun venue for Burners of all stripes to get their dusty dirty day in court. Bring your case! You will be heard! Is it your noisy neighbor? (we had one!) Did your best childhood friend make out with your girlfriend? (a real issue from last year) Did a campmate drink your last cold beer? Maybe it was just your turn to drive the art car. Whatever the dispute, our jurist will sort it out. We will hold court three times during the week or if an emergency arises. Join us Monday afternoon, Wednesday afternoon and Friday afternoon from 3-6pm for fun, laughs, and some serious judgments and some wicked punishments.",

    "description": "Flow Therapy is a sacred space for flow, self-actualization, and fucking around for fucking ever... a space for everyone to lose their inhibitions and become the best versions of themselves. We are huge advocates of Flow, the timeless, selfless, expressive state of being, when our inner critic is silenced and our highest self comes to play. We're a family and community, a California-based collective of dreamers, artists, adventurers, and passionate doers, that loves throwing badass parties as much as we love to connect on deeper levels. We are professionals at being, playing, and faffing about - whether it's dancing, music, yoga, fire spinning, cooking, making art, or a whole lot of nonsense. We're a diverse group of eclectic individuals that operates with deep love and respect on the 10 Principles of Burning Man, that create interactive and magical experiences together as we inspire others to dance, flow, love, and be their free and fearless selves. What is your flow?",
