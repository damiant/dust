Backlit screens will demonstrate the moire pattern as the outer screen rotates around the pipe. There will also be a zoetrope built into the pipe and will have a viewing piece that will give it a old time peep show feel.  The illustrations on the zoetrope will be done by several different artists and we will be able to change the art easily during the event.\nPipe Dreams is an attempt to create a new piece that has the feel of machines that were made in the late 1800's.",

    "description": "This installations is intended to provide a calm meditative space for contemplation and collaboration.  The perimeter is defined by four benches, a couple of which have content about astrophysics and our connection to every single thing in the known universe.   Ceramic \"planets\" ranging in diameter from 4\" to 15\" are tethered to a pillar at the central base with coated wire cables, and can be rotated around the base.  The length of the cables varies, so that each planet has a different orbit. The planets have to be moved at more or less the same time, so people will have to work together to do that .    The installation has been supported by RAT, Renewables for Artists Team, and all components are lit with solar power.  There are lights on the cables that the planets are connected to, there is a bright light coming out of the base of the platform, and the benches will have solar path lights as well.  There is a scavenger hunt for one of the planets, Venus on Wednesday.",

We make our way past crowds of similarly effected people and find ourselves in front of a strange structure. We push the activation device and the art piece comes to life. Multiple pyramid faces of various themes light up in individual sequences and chimes sound above our heads!  A fish, rocket ship, palm tree, (an eggplant?), a planet surround by stars.....why so many different thoughts and meanings? This is something we'll discuss for the rest of the night.",

The night effect similarly creates the experience of an infinite expanse and portal to another world amid the nighttime playa.\n\nThe stone pillars are 30 inches apart and ten feet tall, weighing over 2000 lbs. They create an oppressive physical space when walking between, yet the mirror (day) and light (night) relieve this sense when perfectly between the monoliths.",

    "description": "In Reno's heart, a beacon of absurdity and low income housing shone at the corner of up-and-coming and pushed out. The \"Best Bet\" Motel was not the \"best\" for decor, but it provided shelter for our neighbors experiencing homelessness. Torn down in the name of \"Californian progress,\" we erect a monument to the not-soon-forgotten \"Don't Be Crasy\" sign which illuminated the motel parking lot. \r\n\r\nWe present the \"Last Bet\" Motel, complete with separated rooms and mannequin \"guests.\"\r\nGleaming chrome mannequins encroach, fueled by the greed and capital of privilege, armed with demolition tools. Their threatening postures evoke fear and rage, as they plan to take the Motel for themselves and leave nothing for the folks that made it their home.",

Colorful fabric pieces flutter from the canopy in the desert air during the day. At night, a rainbow of lights frame the playa. Laughter, beats, fire-breathing art cars provide the soundtrack. People are drawn to this resting place, whether by the white steed of a bed in the austere desert & bit of shade provided during the day or by the dreamy lights of the bed at night. While there, people pile onto the bed &, inspired by the surroundings, they share their dreams with others. 'Dreaming' invites all people to pause in their journey. And here, people don't sleep to dream but wake to live their dreams.",

At night, The Last Ocean will glow with vibrant animated light, cycling through a diverse palette of carefully curated colors as visitors interact with the work. Participants will splash and dance in waves of light, illuminating the organic and powerful nature of our oceans.",

Additionally, the spiritual entities affecting each participant will be enlisted in sustaining the healing and embodiment of R.I.D.E. \nBurning of the totem is intentionally simple, restoring focus to primitive fires ancestors held ceremony with and the rising phoenix empowers regeneration and healing.",

Each lantern will be a box 3' tall and 2' wide on a 3' high stand. Each will consist of a wood box housing a faux stained-glass panel on each vertical face. Each lantern will be lit from within and will be topped with a light pole. On the top of each pole will be an LED beacon that will display a variety of enticing colors designed to draw viewers in from across the playa. At the base of each pole will be a button that, if pressed and held down, will cause the beacon to dim. The lanterns will be arranged in a regular square grid with the lanterns 6' apart on center.",

Each tree stands as a unique sculpture, an individual entity, made more beautiful by its initial struggle for sun, the resistance to gravity, and ultimately the sculpting by blazing wildfire heat.  \n\nThe installation poses questions regarding humanities ongoing relationship to the element of fire. Is FIRE friend or foe; teacher, healer, provider or malevolent force? Accompanying  the grove an interactive altar provides a space for 2D art and written word responses to the questions.",

Barbie is a plastic aesthetic that degrades the Burning Man culture with a false identity and unrealistic proportions.\n\nIf we love ourselves, honor those that create love and not what defines eating disorders. If we must pretend to be others, at least let it be a revolutionary countercultural visionary.\n\nThen, like all great Burning Man art pieces, climb inside, learn about Larry, take a selfie and depart for other shiny sparkly things.",

The hearts will each have propane burners, creating spectacular blue and orange flames as the metal glows red. Each heart will be unique; the stands' and hearts' design being  influenced by different art genres. Our purpose is to create a place for people to come together around the fire. To us this is a place of remembrance of our lost brother and son Skyler. To others this can also be a place to embrace, love, let go, or take a little time to relax and appreciate life in the moment.",

The slightest change in perspective creates an evolution in form, which will be seen from great distances, especially at night.  The three layers create valleys that participants can walk through, shifting focus from layers to an internal landscape.  Motion sensors set at the ends, and in other locations, will act as gateways, activating waves of complimentary colors through the more stable slow evolution of color in fiber optic systems lining every vertical element.  The work is meant to reflect on the complexity of layering energy and relationships, which shifts with only the slightest change",

Once hunted to the brink of extinction, whales are now protected by international law due to individuals coming together to act. This installation demonstrates that an individual can have an impact both on the people around them but also on the planet as a whole.",

As a result, an aesthetically bonding interactive experience is created. We treat Playa as our 6th element, which we employ to promote connection through expression, where burners are be invited to share a moment of wonder. Visually, for most of the day the sun creates a colour spectacle and the night a light performance results in an autonomous environment. It becomes the playa in a translated form that's represented as a triangular prism. There are 4 swings which promote random meetings which allow interaction (outwards) or a moment of shared vulnerability. (inwards)",

A host of witches, maidens, mothers, and crones reach out through transcendent images of photographic magic to deliver messages of poetic healing. Four outposts at the four compass directions embody the minor arcana, the characters and scenarios of life's endless stories. At their center are twenty-two doors, each leading inward to the primal light of consciousness by way of the major arcana, the ultimate symbols of life's infinite transformative power. Each sunset calls a mysterious cast of time travelers to light the central fire.",

It is in the splendor of the sunrise that, every day, the hope of a part of humanity that is committed to building a planet where cultures meet to CELEBRATE AND design new paths for a FREE Earth in PEACE is renewed.",

To experience To5E, two or more burners will ascend to the top of a short altar to stand on an inset, clear plexiglass disk, triggering hidden pressure sensors. When triggered, beams of light will shoot out from four surrounding stone pillars in colors representing Earth, Air, Water and Fire onto the participants on the altar, then a powerful beam of white light will illuminate the participants from below as they kiss or embrace, illuminating the surrounding area as they become the element of love until the lighting effect times out and fades to make space for other participants.",

It is said that in the universe in which we live is none other than Brahma, who creates the world through his dream, manifesting himself through the minds of mankind. The property of the consciousness of the god is to create reality through thought, as a passive observer of existence.

The direction of the beam is aimed by volunteer \"Beamers\".  \n\nThe Art occurs  when Observers see the light and there is a Beamer aiming the beam to the Observer.

    "description": "Inspired by vintage Las Vegas casino signs and a healthy sense of irony, the BORiNG sign is an 18-ft tall, 20-ft long reminder to never take one's self  too seriously. The sign is made out of reclaimed sheet metal and discarded letters from dismantled corporate signs, hand painted, lit by 300 LED bulbs and securely attached to a welded base with wheels (and sometimes, pedal-power). The piece is fully mobile across the playa. You can usually find the BORiNG sign accompanying burns, alongside popular art projects, and framing the silhouette of the Man at sunset. With four 500-watt speakers and a playlist of danceables from the 60s, 70s and 80s, the mobile, rolling sign often attracts an entourage of sunset or late night boogie revelers.",

There is a recording device 5 feet high on the lamp pole where burners can interact with the art work by recording snarky comments into the audio system to be played back when the next burner triggers the motion sensor.

A place to confront existential dread with an appeal to the immediacy of the moment, a view of a horizon toward the future, and a reckoning and reflection of the past. Hard questions may arise. But so too, wonder and awe, and maybe understanding and hope. In this moment we can ask ourselves, What's The Point ?",

The trees are to be arranged on a square grid, 10 trees by 10 trees, placed in concentrically smaller grids and culminating in an open area at the center. The forest will be bathed in dancing LED lights of multitude of colors shining through the shaped cutouts in the trees.   Citizens of Black Rock Desert will be able to see the forest for miles.   My hope is the forest will be placed in deep playa past the temple so it will be dark enough for the forest to shine.  Our hope is for participants will interact with the forest in the most magical way.   As one will enter the forest, the will find a world of colorful beauty where one can let go, dance, be silly, discover a new more playful self.   As an installation artist my goal is to create art that is experiential.  With the Forest, participants not only physically walk through and explore the piece, they get lost in the space and become one with the forest.",

From the distance, the head will look familiar; as if a forgotten culture had left it a millenia ago. \n\nThis installation represents ourselves while in ego (represented by day) and in Oneness (night); that we are all a part of universal consciousness. \n\nWhere the face and should be is a blank area representing the melding of all faces. Inside the hallowed-out head is a place where people can sit. Drawn inside the shell of the head are all kinds of ideas with pictograms depicting ideas that can filter through a person's head. At night, the pictographs are superseded by light images of cosmos representing our infinite minds beyond the mind chatter.",

When the sun hits these molecules they vibrate, creating energy that is warming up the planet. The logical solution would be to slash carbon emissions, and focus all our energy on healing ecosystems to bring down carbon levels in the air. However, the data shows that the richest 10% of the planet account for 52% of emissions, and the richest 1% emit more than double the emissions of the poorest half of humanity. It's time for radical honesty.",

After being invited to BM last minute, she decided to create a sperm bank, with a spin that emphasizes people to think about growing their emotional intelligence not only for themselves but for potential future kids. \n\nIt's a 30 gallon metal container, with \"Elon's Sperm Bank\" written in wooden block letters on the exterior. Once people open the hinge top, fog comes out of it (water + dry ice), exposing a message, \"deez nutz\", surrounded by red roses. Also inside is an interactive white board that says, \"No kids? What if you could have Elon's kids? IQ: Nature Guaranteed. EQ: Nurturing Required.\" and a booklet on why therapy for men is important.

The idea is that we are all love, that we are one connected being making up the whole world. We are and are not individuals, we are and are not a collective, we are both at once. \n\nThe leaves will be made of copper with a green patina, the branches and trunk will be out of a brown patina(ed) copper. \n\nThe piece will be about eleven or twelve feet tall, so it will be an intimate piece allowing participance to get close to it and bask in it's shade during the heat of the day.",

It belongs to everyone and no one. It's for whoever is there to decide what it is and how to interact with it. It invites people to participate how they see fit, creating a temporary definition of what it is unmediated by its creators. This constantly changes its reality and the reality of those who happen upon it. It's premeditated and in the moment. It's learning from the past. It's an endless stream of alternate futures. It's the smallest details that together make a bigger picture. It's the patterns we form in life, that repeat, and either change or echo forever.  It is what it is.",

I live in the woods of Central Minnesota - a region known for both plywood and pine trees.  I plant trees a lot, so feel I have offset this plywood - plus I am going to install it at home after the playa - I bring this representation of our pine forests to the desert.",

The open air, jungle gym-like skeleton invites multiple burners to simultaneously climb and walk through the sculpture. The entrance to the piece begins at 20' tall, with the gates consistently contracting to 4' at the center, before again expanding outwards to 20'. The open concept will trace striking geometric shadows across the playa floor during the day. At night LED strips, running lengthwise, display intricate animations that accentuate the contraction and expansion of the gates. These LEDs will be both sound and motion reactive, changing their behavior based on the presence of burners or art cars.",

Standing as a symbol of unity, the Face bridges: East & West, spiritual & biological, aquatic & terrestrial, fauna & flora. \n\nAquatic creatures constitute the elements forging the parallax illusion of a genderless portrait collage. Ambient music, sounds of nature, & multilingual echoes of Rumi's call, seduce wandering souls in BRC with a multisensorial composition that awakens the mind.\n\nThe Face beckons to all and guides without advice. The target is meditative dialogue. The process is intentional & incremental: one step at a time, one visitor after the other.",

This piece is designed in layers, with the raging fire being the most readily visible, the thing that all will be seen from a distance.  For those that look closer, the woman will appear within the flames, and for those that look even deeper, it will become apparent that as the noise of the playa increases, so does the intensity of the fire, but the woman, she remains at peace.  Reminding us, that as the world burns, we remain in control of our reactions to it.",

Their God was female. \n\nWe chose to honor ATABEY's symbolism with a fish coming up for air on the Playa in order to bring attention to the state of the Earth and the dire consequences of today's dominant world views, those that are legacies of colonization's victors. ATABEY's legacy is to respect our waters and land.",

It is part innovation in parametrically-designed plywood, part bamboo super-canopy, and part mix of bright textiles sewn together to emulate the beautiful flora and foliage of an enchanted forest. Our longtime crew of professional butterfly aerialists and forest creatures may descend from the trees at opportune moments to enchant and mystify visitors. Our installation is not simply a few large trees and mushrooms, it will be covered, every inch, with immersive art and LEDs made by our talented collective of multimedia artists - transporting visitors into a wonderland of their own narrative.",

Participants live life live (not a typo). One needs to live, but also to do it live & not in a recorded or fake fashion. Too often burners live outside of their reality and not in a present way. Rene Magritte's surrealist art makes the participant question their reality. The text communicates what it is (art) but also what it is not (not a NFT of art). While art exists, it doesn't exist until someone creates some type of physical form. NFTs exist but not in physical form, yet this piece exists as a NFT upon being video'd & made into a NFT, which means what it isn't becomes what it is.",

It is called the Resurrection of the Clothes Peg and is an ode the resurgence of the female voice. The monumental form of an ordinary household item like a wooden peg is meant to evoke a sense of criticality questioning why such a rudimentary form is given such importance. There is a clear dichotomy of male and female energies as the form is heavy and solid and erect - almost phallic, yet the message is about feminine strength. The item represented is a reference to female domestic chores and its function of holding and supporting.",

By enabling a sudden shift in focus from the external world, to infinite self-centered images, participants are invited to make a parallel shift in their habitual perceptions of themselves.\n\nTo develop personal meaning humans inherently have a desire to understand the connection we have with self, tribe & with what we believe to be the universe around us. We can come to understand that to change the smallest part is to change the nature of the whole. Finding balance within duality is where we can find the courage to set ourselves free, to be who we've always felt we are.\n\nSimultaneously singular & infinite; separate & connected.",

It was later adopted by Europe's anti-fascist movement. In the 1960's, most famously through Tommy Smith and John Carlos at the Mexico City Olympics, it became both an iconic symbol of the Black Power Movement and a universal representation of the struggle for civil and human rights. The image symbolizes the ongoing racism and injustice throughout the world, but it is also a beacon of power, pride and perseverance \u2013 holding the promise of 'Hope'.",

Lovingly made from upcycled and reclaimed materials, Astrofengai\u00e1\u2019s frame and walls provide respite from desert heat. Reflective wall cladding acts as a giant lens, focusing sunlight into undulating light patterns that move and morph across the ground. People\u2019s reflections glide across semi-transparent surfaces. Faces merge with foreground and background, like a hall of mirrors. Participants listen through headphones to custom soundscapes crafted from NASA archives, electronica, binaural beats, and human voice. The artwork\u2019s name is a play on words, a contraction of the Greek words for starlight (astrofengi\u00e1) and mother of all life (Gaia).",

This causes the molecules to repeat into a large structure. however the result is not just a neat cube over a neat cube. The crystals jut out at 45 degrees, in an almost anti-gravity fashion. They can balance on the point because of tensegrity, as the stress of the structure is equally distributed to all of its points. When a person interacts with the sculpture, either by crawling inside during the day or playing with the shadow and light at night, they will be come a part of the geometry themselves, seeing the shadows reflecting on their skin and the land around them",

    "description": "THEM invites participants to enter it and identify with the art-making the sculpture into THEM. Through community interactions and the people around us can the sculpture be transformed into new faces. At night those new faces are then expressed upon the playa in shadows created from an internal light. To explore the different personalities of \"THEM\", one must generate commitment as part of the change, and this participation can be done alone but it is much easier to do with the support of a community. The sculpture will act as a meeting point for observation, contemplation, and self-discovery.",

One must look and try to understand that the other, who sees things differently, is not necessarily wrong. \n\nThis unique display emphasizes that nothing in our reality is absolute or unequivocal. Life is everything but black and white. Can you choose to examine life through a broader perspective? What if our solid opinions are also a matter of perspective?",

Cables descending from the top of the cone carry 4800 individually controlled LEDs. Inside the cone are interactive, mechanical \"widgets.\" Participants manipulate the widgets, causing patterns of light to dance across the LEDs.

The essential mechanism behind its working is the controlled bit of sway from the tether pole and the physics of a swinging ball. It also represents the relativity of time. Burners arrive at the art piece intent on watching the mere minutes, but get sucked into the time vortex that Chaotick easily creates and end up staying for much longer feeling as though time is moving slowly. This is a piece for people to watch and become entranced. Seating allows for shared space and burner interaction with other burners. This piece gives a more meditative vibe and a sense of calm in opposite balance of the intensity of the burn.",
