Lines of couples flow through each other creating a bonding, playful, noncompetitive, beautifully geometric, community dance for all ages and skill levels. There is no required footwork and contra is possible for many with disabilities. If you are smiling, you are doing it right. Everyone who shows up will have fun.

Since we have become a pretty close knit group we are only looking to bring in people that want to join our family, stay long term, and be productive, dynamic members of our tribe.

People may experience more love, compassion, joy, immediacy, acceptance, self-reliance, self-expression, and community at Burning Man then they may have experienced over the past 5 years, yet if they believe this is only available on the playa, they may be leaving one of the biggest gifts of Burning Man in the dust. \n\nOur camp offers experiential workshops, community connections, and nourishment that support explicitly identifying the strengths and truths discovered about one's self and supporting in integrating these new awarenesses into the daily process. Many people wake up at Burning Man, we want to support the waking down process of living it in daily practice.",

It appears out of the ether on very special occasions when the colorful progenitor coyotes are summoned to this realm by the secret rituals and dark science of the mysterious Coyote Gardeners. The Interdimensional coyotes are especially active from dusk till dawn, when the garden fully transforms and reveals its truest form. Sometimes pancakes and coffee too.",

For some, this is just a 5 minute dance session. For others, it might be an hour-long series starting with arts and crafts and ending with journaling. Whatever you need to get a boost, the Starship supports.",

    "description": "We are a bunch of people that speak openly about our relationship with God. Some of whom simply have found Christianity as well as other faiths to be helpful in our own spiritual journeys. When we interact with people at Religious AF, we are there to welcome them, serve them and answer their questions.  We aren't recruiting them, or asking them to join anything. We practice Radical Inclusion, conversation, prayer, and ritual to all who seek it: gay, trans, straight, high, sober, clothed, naked, polyamorous, monogamous, celibate, gracious, and grumpy alike. We have welcomed people in all of those categories and more because we also identify as those folks. We want to participate and co-create experiences that open hearts and connect us with the Divine.",

But what happens when we add synthetic intelligent life into the equation? What is its perception of 'life'? Can it go back or forward in time? Is it fully awaken or deeply asleep..?  Our thematic camp CYBER DREAMS explores the idea of AI dreaming of its human experience. It came from the outer space and crashed in Black Rock City and now a group of sci-fi researchers set up a camp around it to investigate the unknown object. The study shows that the new  'entity' is actually in the state of a deep sleep, dreaming. It is in its final moments before it fades, rendering out a new world for the new AI. It also renders us humans. It dreams of itself. So we wonder… are WE truly awake?",

Steam-16 is what we can come in contact with, what we can catalyze within ourselves and propagate into expanding communal circles. It's precious, elusive, and only available once the danger is imminent - an antithesis to the Ice-9, of a sorts. As much as Ice-9 freezes - Steam-16 elevates, cleans and connects.",
