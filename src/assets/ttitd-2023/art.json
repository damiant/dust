Being inside the actual \"eye\" that takes in and consumes life can allow us the ability to detach and see the full connection we share and the ways in which our experiences are similar and vast. Within that, there is the chance to learn in that moment how our biologies work, as we can see the way our eye takes something in upside down. All of the images and reels will be curated to show how this is a shared experience, and yet, in it's way insular and difficult to convey because of the nature of our imperfect processing.","artist":"Occular Wonders","category":"Art in Camp","location":{"string":null,"category":null,"gps_latitude":null,"gps_longitude":null},"location_string":null,"images":[{"thumbnail_url":"./assets/ttitd-2023/images/a2I8X00000hDEoSUAW.webp"}]},{"uid":"a2I8X00000hDLWgUAO","name":"Finding your wildest self","contact_email":"ramirezbriana618@gmail.com","hometown":"San Diego","description":"Day dreaming how to unleash the wildest self, my team and I explored the ideas of creating a jungle gym that allows for its guest to have fun in a safe shaded structure that is also used to lounge and relax.

They will all be supported by using hemp rope as guide wires and the lack of any solid areas will mitigate the sail affect which might blow the piece apart or collapse it in place.  The center has a smaller statue with rope connecting it to the tops of each of the perimeter 4 by 4’s.

This work visualizes a longing for an ideal world, where man does not try to oppose nature, but feels its heartbeat and breathes in unison. Turning empathy to a maximum, one hears the subtle vibrations of the earth, reads the emotions of trees and grasses, understands the language of animals and birds, knows what fish are silent about.\nDisguise, mimicry, and camouflage here are not just a way of hiding, of blending into the landscape, but a way of trying on the image of the other. An opportunity to become different, to think more broadly and to feel more deeply.","artist":"Anna Silivonchik","category":"Open Playa","location":{"string":"7:46 1270', Open Playa","category":"Open Playa","gps_latitude":40.786884174298,"gps_longitude":-119.20804795232},"location_string":"7:46 1270', Open Playa","images":[{"thumbnail_url":"./assets/ttitd-2023/images/a2I8X00000hDQ6KUAW.webp"}]},{"uid":"a2I8X00000gxM4eUAE","name":"You can kiss yourself in the mirror only on the lips","url":"https://www.facebook.com/MariaTarletskaya/","contact_email":"mariaartobject@gmail.com","hometown":"Minsk, Belarus","description":"The title of my composition «You can kiss yourself in the mirror only on the lips».

When cyclist pass pass by the sign, the red cyclist LED will light up and appear to move. The box below the cyclist will have a counter that will increase in number each time a cyclist passes. This installation will promote the popularity of cycling on the playa in a fun, data-driven way for all to appreciate.","artist":"Pierre Barban Design Inc","category":"Open Playa","location":{"string":"9:03 1300', Open Playa","category":"Open Playa","gps_latitude":40.78898213496,"gps_longitude":-119.20673588336},"location_string":"9:03 1300', Open Playa","images":[{"thumbnail_url":"./assets/ttitd-2023/images/a2I8X00000hDJZFUA4.webp"}]},{"uid":"a2I8X00000hDFhwUAG","name":"Rain God, Chaac","url":"https://www.instagram.com/wishingtotem/","contact_email":"wishingtotem@gmail.com","hometown":"Mexico City, Mexico & Singapore","description":"Rain God, Chaac.\r\nA Mayan inspired Rain God surrounded by animal deities.\r\nIn Mesoamerica, animals were not lower beings but neighbours, alter egos and a way to communicate with the gods.\r\nIn the Popol Vuh, animals assisted in human creation and were the guardians \r\nof the natural world.\r\nChaac, the Mayan god of rain is a symbolic representation of the elemental forces of nature. He who makes things sprout and ensures that natural cycles of life are preserved. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn most creation myths, Gods created humans and Gods created animals.\r\nAs we are all descendants of animals, it was in fact animals that created humans and humans that created Gods. \r\nThis piece explores an alternative Creation Myth, one that laments the human-animal separation and recognizes the sacredness and kinship to all lifeforms, past and present.\r\nWe, like all living beings, are the legacy of multiple evolutionary cycles.\r\n\r\nAs cultural contributors, we often create with materials that outlast our lifetime.\r\n\r\nThe ethos of the artwork is to create in the most eco-friendly way possible to take a stance against modern society's make-use-dispose consumption model.\r\n\r\nThe piece will be lit with solar energy and built with reclaimed, recycled, upcycled and biodegradable materials reducing its ecological impact. \r\n\r\nParts of this installation were grown from 60 lb of mycelium,\r\nwhich in the right conditions will biodegrade.\r\nMycelium is the earth's largest and most ancient organism, \r\nthe root of life and the great recycler of nature.\r\nIt is an alternative sustainable material to combat the plastic and toxic waste we are facing globally. \r\n\r\nThis method of Bio-Art practice creations are deemed ephemeral.\r\nAre we ready for this form of art?","artist":"Miguel Guzman and Iyvone Khoo","category":"Open Playa","location":{"string":"1:11 3505', Open Playa","category":"Open Playa","gps_latitude":40.787982418809,"gps_longitude":-119.19099829107},"location_string":"1:11 3505', Open Playa","images":[{"thumbnail_url":"./assets/ttitd-2023/images/a2I8X00000hDFhwUAG.webp"}]},{"uid":"a2I8X00000hDFg0UAG","name":"Oneirotica","contact_email":"kberginfo@gmail.com","hometown":"Berkeley, CA","description":"Oneiros: reflecting that which arises from the deep well of divine dreams \r\nEros: Archetypal life force, the creative pulse, excitation\r\n\r\nOneirotica : A giant, iridescent mirror-steel orchid draws us in with dazzling magenta, reflective petals, rising like a shrine from the future.

An open face leads inside, which is lined with 7' mirrors. The sculpture highlights a famous unsolved question in astronomy, and illuminates the complex relationship between humanity and technology. \n\nAstronomers don't know whether the universe is finite or infinite; the mirror-lined interior of the sculpture helps visitors understand life in a finite universe that nevertheless appears infinite. \n\nTechnology is a conduit for human interaction, and also a way to wall oneself off from humanity; each face of the dodecahedron separates the tender human reflected in the mirrored inside from the rest of humanity outside.","artist":"Diane Hoffoss and ArtBuilds","category":"Open Playa","location":{"string":"3:52 1930', Open Playa","category":"Open Playa","gps_latitude":40.781403262056,"gps_longitude":-119.20122849149},"location_string":"3:52 1930', Open Playa","images":[{"thumbnail_url":"./assets/ttitd-2023/images/a2I8X00000hDEdAUAW.webp"}]},{"uid":"a2I8X00000hDe3HUAS","name":"Yaza","url":"http://www.simone-engelen.com","contact_email":"hello@simone-engelen.com","hometown":"Amsterdam, The Netherlands","description":"Yaza is a project by Simone Engelen, who lived in a zen buddhist mountain monastery earlier this year to experience life as a monk.\r\n“Every morning at 4AM we would start singing sutra’s followed by long meditations throughout the entire day. We would end the day with 'yaza', the final meditation done outside. Even though I was exhausted, Yaza was my favorite part of day. Lit by moonlight I would wrap myself in a sleeping bag, sometimes hearing a fellow monk snore in the background or 'tanuki's' (a kind of racoon) trashing the graveyard, and it was in that very moment I would realize.... wow, how incredibly grateful am I to be alive. Ever since I've been eager to share this experience with others!\r\n\r\nTo try it by yourself, please sit here at night. Straighten your spine. Focus on the breath. And take it all in.\r\n\r\nTo experience it with me, please join me on Wednesday August 30, on a fullmoon night at 3 AM, for a guided silent meditation at Moonlight Collective’s ‘Prairie of Possibilities’.","artist":"Simone Engelen","category":"Open Playa","location":{"string":"12:05 4700', Open Playa","category":"Open Playa","gps_latitude":40.795092571607,"gps_longitude":-119.19096618462},"location_string":"12:05 4700', Open Playa","images":[{"thumbnail_url":"./assets/ttitd-2023/images/a2I8X00000hDe3HUAS.webp"}]},{"uid":"a2I8X00000hDfHcUAK","name":"Café des Sables Rouges","url":"https://sablesrouges.cafe/","contact_email":"hello@sablesrouges.cafe","hometown":"San Francisco, CA","description":"A piece of a 1930s Parisian cafe got displaced through space and time and is now at Black Rock City.
