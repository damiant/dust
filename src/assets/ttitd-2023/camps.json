We provide a place where folks can join together and throw one of the custom stamped discs loaned out at the camp. You can win one at one of our tournaments or events! The course is accessible 24/7, and discs glow in the dark so don't hesitate to swing by late night/early morning for a round. \n\nWe also have some mushroom hazards on the course! We have tall ones, small ones, ones that glow, and ones that show you what disc golf is all about. It's definitely a psychedelic experience to walk through, even if you aren't in the mood to play a round. Just make sure to listen for the call of, \"FORE!\""

This camp creates a place to share Indigenous culture and educate all who want to join our camp or our events to learn. IPOW is a place to spread Indigenous culture, teachings, and help all who want to learn about who Indigenous people are and were. We would be honored if our Two Spirit community would be an integral part of our camp. The camp is safe space for all Indigenous people and allies. It is a place people can learn and share traditions, foods before and after colonization, games, storytelling, languages, and music. In 2023 the camp will continue the buffalo theme as \"Buffalo Rising.\""

When we pursue the light we use movement, the senses, sensuality, sexuality and connection. This beckons us in and brings the light of awareness back into the bodies we have vacated. To go there fully requires confronting our shadows. We embrace those as well as we dive into shame, fear, anger, unsavory memories from this life and past lives, and disempowering images of our bodies. Welcome home."

We are opening up our camp this year to anyone who is in a motorhome and wants to hook into our electrical grid.\n\nNot only do we produce power for ourselves and reduce our carbon footprint in the process, we also share with all of BRC with our public charging station.

We love to have fun and strive to recreate the wide-eyed wonder and whimsy of the playa in everything we do - plus we founded the House of Good Deeds, one of the largest Burners Without Borders and fully volunteer-run organizations in all of New York City!"

Tue-Fri, 1-5, celebrate and beat the heat in the bar in a large, cool desert tent from India or sit by the hypnotic burn barrel at night! Or play volleyball during the day. We have discussion groups (e.g. Stoic philosophy, the importance of kindness) or storytelling hour before the bar opens.  We have incarnated this small camp (30 people) since 2003, so we have figured out some infrastructure stuff and are happy to share our knowledge."

    "description": "Joyism is a camp of some 50 people, whose major contribution is to provide coffee in the mornings between 8 and 11 AM. Several hundred people come by every day. It is clearly a very valuable commodity. We have to bring in a large quantity of water, and we have at least five urns simmering at any one time. People come from several blocks away. Joyism camp is also the informal home of the Joyism artcar, the temple of our new religion Joyism, and from which we serve up, live bands on the front, margaritas for participants of critical tits, and Playa weddings. We also have a climbing wall for users of all levels."

We're a camp of seasoned burners looking to create a unique experience for the community in the only way we know how: through food, music and quirky performance art. \n\nOur ragtag crew will transport you to an imagined past, where crustaceans roamed the frontier. From shrimp snacks and cold drinks to the INFAMOUS SEAHORSE RODEO to our raucous music, on and off camp, get ready to live your nautical fantasy and somehow leave you weirdly warmer than you came."

We offer an intimate and cozy environment.\nYou won't find any grandiose installations or flashy decorations. Instead, you'll find a humble gathering of burners who are there to share stories, ideas, and experiences. The focus is on creating a space that allows for genuine interactions and deep conversations.\nIt is a testament to the idea that bigger isn't always better. We place a strong emphasis on creating a welcoming and inclusive environment, and create a space where everyone feels comfortable and valued, regardless of their background or beliefs. \nAt the Tiniest Camp, you can disconnect from the distractions of modern life and truly engage with the people around you. It's a beautiful thing to witness."

The vast majority of these have been saved from the Caribbean and Mediterranean seas, after boat holidays and their owners see them as single-use hard plastic and discard them, we have collected them and brought them home. A lot of camp members work on boats and in a perfect position to save these inflatables and repurpose them in Black Rock City."

This shared experience resonates deeply with the journey of immigrants, refugees, and boat people, who leave behind everything they know to navigate unfamiliar territory in search of a sense of home in an unlikely place. Black Rock City Refugee Camp celebrates the strength, resilience, ingenuity, and compassion of these remarkable communities. \r\n\r\nWith open hearts, we welcome all who seek solace, camaraderie, and belonging. Join our journey of resilience and celebration, as we create a space where the enduring spirit of immigrants, refugees, and boat people shines brightly in the heart of Black Rock City."

To experience hygge usually means you are sitting with blankets, surrounded by pillows and candles. You may be playing puzzles or board games. You may be cuddling with a good book. All of these things are Hygge and this is exactly what our camp will offer."

Each of those gatherings generates micro-community among those Burners brought together."

And like each bubble, each person and their life is beautiful and unique. Bubbles are also temporary and once they pop they become part of the universe, just as we do when we die. When people encounter bubbles it is a like a rare moment of magic. They symbolize our childhood innocence, reminding us of a time when life was simple and carefree. When we see these glass-like orbs dancing in the air they remind us to live in the moment, let go, dance with a stranger, be silly - have a bubblegasm!"

This is central to our ability to use our hands, interact with, and learn to live in the world. \n\nLife is magical when we are at play and we can create; we find solace in stories that had the power to magically transport. To play is at the core of being human. It's a form of Radical Self-Expression. Playful Again is an invitation to reclaim our birthright of joy. Learn more: https://playfulagain.org"
