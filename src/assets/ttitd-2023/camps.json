Mr. Darwin thinks that whales may be bears which have enormously increased their bulk, washed their paws into fins by constant swimming, and stretched their mouths by keeping them open to catch insects in the water. So also he thinks that men and women may have been developed out of monkeys, monkeys out of mushrooms, and mushrooms out of \" monads,\" or little clots of jelly. Where is the proof? Where is a single instance of a bearwhale, or a man-monkey, to be seen? Of course there is not one.",

The vast majority of these have been saved from the Caribbean and Mediterranean seas, after boat holidays and their owners see them as single-use hard plastic and discard them, we have collected them and brought them home. A lot of camp members work on boats and in a perfect position to save these inflatables and repurpose them in Black Rock City.",

And like each bubble, each person and their life is beautiful and unique. Bubbles are also temporary and once they pop they become part of the universe, just as we do when we die. When people encounter bubbles it is a like a rare moment of magic. They symbolize our childhood innocence, reminding us of a time when life was simple and carefree. When we see these glass-like orbs dancing in the air they remind us to live in the moment, let go, dance with a stranger, be silly - have a bubblegasm!",
